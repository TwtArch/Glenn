Media accounts?  How about measuring by victims?  And measure percentages also. Do it that way and see if they still say "They are not dangerous, they are in danger". https://twitter.com/jihadwatchRS/status/1313524588639408146

The government, or geneticists or any other body can classify races in whatever way they want to, but I think to the social justice warriors, he is not black, and therefore he is white.   That's what the thought process seemed to be when they were so outraged.

It was about a white defending themself against a black that outraged them.  Here is another example of the same thing. It's not just about the police, is it‚ÅâÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/3AoF4t4I4S

These Democrats pretend to be for racial justice and equality. Their behavior proves the opposite. https://twitter.com/h7n33n/status/1313442540163604480

Look at all of the threats, the beatings, the vandalism, property destruction, fires, and murders they have committed.  Don't ever let anyone tell you the white supremacy is not one of our biggest problems... https://twitter.com/h7n33n/status/1313431914561384448

Remember he's had to deal with a Democrat Party that is trying to shut down and keep down the country in order to win the election.  So he has had to counter that as part of his messaging. The Democrats trying to destroy the country is not an easy thing to manage. https://twitter.com/Moshepupik1/status/1313109098745880581

Beautiful and powerful Kayleigh will quickly get through this and then join the growing army of the "COVID Immune".

* [ 6 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201006093452/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1313359382684594176): I think Trump's best chance to beat him is with the debates.  It gives Trump the chance to tell America what the left really stands for and it also puts Biden in a place where he can get really lost in front of the American People.  I think the more debates, the better.

Without those to rely on (and maybe even an in-ear radio receiver) Biden would be trying very hard to avoid the debates.ü§î

But he has COVID and he is very overweight, and I do hope he comes through this w/o any problems.üôè

Trying to infect him with the Coronavirus would not be out of step with what they have already done.  It wouldn't surprise me at all if they did it.

In fact, the reasons have varied from one end of the spectrum to the other:  (Too poor/rich, weak/strong, religious/secular liberal/conservative, etc)  To me, Jew-hatred appears to be supernatural and preordained. https://twitter.com/CrownedRex/status/1312013963777896448

And the rioting after a police shooting or a white on black shooting like with George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin certainly is.

In fact, NOT AT ALL, because you are the first to have mentioned it.   Even if he didn't have a gun the cop did the only thing he could have done.  This was the rapists decision to cause the shooting.

If the races were reversed though, and a white rapist of a black girl under 16 resisted like that and the black police officer shot him, the officer would be hailed as a hero, the criminal would be a villain, and everyone would agree with that. https://twitter.com/Russian_Bot_Liz/status/1298600019780673536

My theory, and I'm not adopting this yet...just exploring it, is that China wanted Trump out of the way and they figured out a novel way to accomplish that.

Since about 1960-65 things have been flipped on their head.  You don't see it because of the false news media  and our leftist lieing school system.
* [18 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200818145938/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1295736869939032064): The fact is that if you were really against racism you would be aghast at what is going on.  You are only against white people because youve been indoctrinated.

Why are there such society convulsions when horrible criminals resisting arrest are hurt by the police (but not when perfectly innocent white people are hurt by blacks for no reason?  And that happens all the time.  So why no reaction?

I've walked through and worked in so called black neighborhoods.  I'm talking about walking through real black crime ridden neighborhoods.  Along the side streets and alleys. They wont even deliver in these murderous neighborhoods.

I don't think there was ever a paralel in this country against blacks or anyone else, at least not since the year 1900 or so.

Not the other way around.   Crime happens.  I guess you would have said that in the old south when it was the opposite of what it is today all over our country.
* [18 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200818143515/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1295729298775724032): You Lose, and of course you do, because your all about imagination and indoctrination.  You have nothing else.

You just see it everywhere and somehow let your brain process it into something else.

We have a democracy, still, even though when you guys get in charge that will end.   We vote on things.  We don't use violence to go against the will of the voters.   We can take the statues down, by consensus, and put them somewhere else.

It is a real problem that dwarfs the issue of exaggerated violence against blacks by the police.  It absolutely dwarfs it!

You need a whole lot more excuses then I do because the whole thrust of your party is racist, says it out loud, and defends it.  My side rejects it and rejects anyone on either side who endorses it.
