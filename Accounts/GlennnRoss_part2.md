Media accounts?  How about measuring by victims?  And measure percentages also. Do it that way and see if they still say "They are not dangerous, they are in danger". https://twitter.com/jihadwatchRS/status/1313524588639408146

The government, or geneticists or any other body can classify races in whatever way they want to, but I think to the social justice warriors, he is not black, and therefore he is white.   That's what the thought process seemed to be when they were so outraged.

It was about a white defending themself against a black that outraged them.  Here is another example of the same thing. It's not just about the police, is it⁉️ pic.twitter.com/3AoF4t4I4S

These Democrats pretend to be for racial justice and equality. Their behavior proves the opposite. https://twitter.com/h7n33n/status/1313442540163604480

They think it was All Just a Big Fake-Out to Avoid Debating that Master of the Spoken Word: Joseph Biden🤪 These are the people that Israel has had to deal with.

They have to be both hateful and stupid in order to buy into such obvious absurdities. https://twitter.com/ConspiracyLibel/status/1313479293188681728

Look at all of the threats, the beatings, the vandalism, property destruction, fires, and murders they have committed.  Don't ever let anyone tell you the white supremacy is not one of our biggest problems... https://twitter.com/h7n33n/status/1313431914561384448

Remember he's had to deal with a Democrat Party that is trying to shut down and keep down the country in order to win the election.  So he has had to counter that as part of his messaging. The Democrats trying to destroy the country is not an easy thing to manage. https://twitter.com/Moshepupik1/status/1313109098745880581

Beautiful and powerful Kayleigh will quickly get through this and then join the growing army of the "COVID Immune".

* [ 6 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201006093452/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1313359382684594176): I think Trump's best chance to beat him is with the debates.  It gives Trump the chance to tell America what the left really stands for and it also puts Biden in a place where he can get really lost in front of the American People.  I think the more debates, the better.
* [ 6 October 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201007044400/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1313354461641953280): https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/518889-biden-will-keep-debating-trump-campaign-says   If Biden sincerely wants to continue debating Trump, that tells me that he is being supplemented with performance-enhancing drugs.  Without those to rely on (and maybe even an in-ear radio receiver) Biden would be trying very hard to avoid the debates.🤔

But he has COVID and he is very overweight, and I do hope he comes through this w/o any problems.🙏

Trying to infect him with the Coronavirus would not be out of step with what they have already done.  It wouldn't surprise me at all if they did it.

Would you put it past these people after seeing what they have done from the time that Trump jumped into the race right up until the present moment? I wouldn't. pic.twitter.com/z6aN2yyA98

In fact, the reasons have varied from one end of the spectrum to the other:  (Too poor/rich, weak/strong, religious/secular liberal/conservative, etc)  To me, Jew-hatred appears to be supernatural and preordained. https://twitter.com/CrownedRex/status/1312013963777896448

Your questions are stereotypical and you don't offer any arguments.  You just keep repeating the same questions, even after they are answered.  You don't even try to rebutt them.

Trump is less of a racist than any democrat that has run since Lyndon Johnson I don't know for sure that it is Hawaii.  He is a major liar, his party does nothing but lie.

Expelling a hostile, warring, murderous force that will not agree to peace, and will not cease its attacks is not ethnic cleansing.

It's obvious he was just trying to be positive about it.  It was obvious when he came out and spoke about it at the time.  It's not what he says, which is trying to avoid panic, but what he does.

He is the most corrupt vice president in American History and sold his office for hard cash to every family member.  He's been doing it for decades.  See Rudy Giuliani and P. Schweizer.

People outside of this country get their knowledge through the worldwide leftist press.  They think we are the most racist country, and that Trump is a dumb right-wing Gorilla.

So there is that... And you're welcome. But I think your ideas are based on the largest disinformation campaign in the history of the world.  It all started decades ago when the left decided to take over educ.

Even if that were overstated, just cut it down by 2/3 and you still have a leftist dystopia.    Are you arguing that they won't turn this country into a dystopian shithole?

Why do stupid leftists value something like 'not being racist' more than judging people or groups based on their behavior?  You allow all kinds of terrible cruelty to take place, rather than opposing it because "that is racist".  I find that appauling.

If the races were reversed though, and a white rapist of a black girl under 16 resisted like that and the black police officer shot him, the officer would be hailed as a hero, the criminal would be a villain, and everyone would agree with that. https://twitter.com/Russian_Bot_Liz/status/1298600019780673536

Trump's response was more aggressive than the majority of other nations.  We are richer and used more resources to confront it than others did.  I'm starting to smell a rat.  Maybe a Demonrat?

It's not what I see with my own eyes. I believe that the white on black crime is inflated in that graph. Either by the criteria used to define it  or just plain P.C. human bias. In fact I don't trust any of these measurements.

In fact, the more reasonable action should be that parents and citizens should have a right to monitor their children at our taxpayer-funded schools. Why should only the police have to be under surveillance?

The narrative that the MSM promotes is extremely  unrepresentative of crime in America. The media's depiction of blacks being the victims of racist crime is not just untrue. It is quite literally the opposite of the truth.

In their socialist plan, they forgot that they can only even imagine those things because we now have a mega-rich capitalist economy.

Yes, the left has worked so hard to discredit him, and others that are telling the truth.  When you control the schools and the media, the population is very easy to brainwash.

I think he was still in his 20s. Look at how the ACTUAL FASCIST Obama put him in prison.
