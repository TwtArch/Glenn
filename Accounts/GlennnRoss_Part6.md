Any federal judge anywhere could stop a president right in his tracks?  If so, I don't  recall it ever before being so promiscuously overused as it is being overused now. https://twitter.com/vintperformance/status/1199795305731874816

I sware to u right now that you could probably have more Jews die than Arabs!  I mean it. All u have to do is act like civilized human beings. Trust me, this will work, but please don't tell anyone I told you this. I'll lose my rep.

I fully expect people being born today to live until 150 yrs old.  I sincerely do. Has Sweeden acknowledged it yet?

Remember, Pakistan started all the way back to the very same time Israel started.  It wasn't until 92 that things started to warm up a little between them.  This new Indian president is Pro America and Pro Israelüëä pic.twitter.com/Hb93M7ts5O

That's the bottom number, IMO In 2024 It will 60% GOP.  By 2030, Their won't be any Jewish Dems left, to speak of. The migration of blacks will follow a similar pattern.  The GOP will move to the ctr; the Dems, far, far left.

He said he has Ironclad proof of Biden's crimes and that he thinks they may try to kill him.  He said he wasn't afraid of the Mafia, who he took down as a fed prosecutor, and he's not afraid of them!!  Can you imagine!?
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127022953/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199511147973615618): It's coming back to me now.....

* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127023137/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199507021114028034): Another schmuck.

Some people suffer much more than others.  Who knows how much a species or an individual member of that species suffers. It could even be worse than U or I ‚ÅâÔ∏èCastration w/o anesthesia, during, or after‚ÅâÔ∏èüò°üò° https://twitter.com/FiniteChances/status/1199456567180947456

They are getting more friendly the Sunni nations and militarily, I think they can stand alone. The biggest and most awesome friendship they are developing is with India.  1.4 billion people and a fast-growing economy and tech sector.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127014231/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199499224230043648): They blatantly lie. Blatant, in your face, lying.  And because they control almost all the means of communication, they largely get away with it.  It is even worse with the Dem Party.  There repeated lies are just shocking and the media actually backs them up.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127013446/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199498127197319169): "Left-Wing Seminaries" haha
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127021033/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199497164596170758): I just went to your page and it brought some of it back. I remember we talked about the Tinkerbelle story. I don't know if I was a little crazy about Avatars and Twitter names then, in fact, your terrific Avatar and Twitter name might have been what started it for me.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127012957/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199494573128634368): Hey thereüëã  Nice to see you again. I remember you, but not what we talked about or what your philosophy was.  I remember that you had a sense of humor though.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127014938/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199493436413562881): A lot of our best conservative thinkers a Jewish though:  A minority...by the way that will change as the left gains power. But Milton Freidman Mark Levin Dennis Prager Charles Krauthammer Michael Medved Ben Shapiro Increasingly Alan Dershowitz Andrew Breitbart & much more!
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127011621/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199491113071128578): No.  I think they did this on purpose.  Kind of like a loose conspiracy.  They decided to take over by taking over the schools.  I think this all started in the 1960s.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127005141/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199489687045509120): Did u Know that it wasn't Churchill who said that first?  It was really John Adams, one of our founding fathers and one of the first presidents.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127005350/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199488204988190721): Are you the same TinkerBelle I chatted with so long ago?  Do you remember me?
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127011601/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199487343159369729): "Londoner Livin in N.Yorks coast" Boy did I read that wrong, haha.  That sounds very, very nice Dave.  If things turn bad, it should take much longer to hit there....if ever.  It's all about the people you live near and interact with.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127005400/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199486209300606976): It's not weird because it is through education that they are getting it.  Parenthetically, it was largely the educated who pulled Germany into Nazism and Communist countries into that ideology.   That's where the leftist thought is coming from now.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127003730/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199485182790787072): The second way, is through some kind of war, or terrorist attack on the west.  A possible third way could be that people just come to reject the lunacy of the left...but they are showing a willingness to maintain power through corrupt means.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127010808/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199484448552751104): I agree with that 100%.  It's imperative that I am wrong.  I see a couple of ways to change course. Trump gets a Republican Congress and just does spectacular in his second term, thus bringing the country to his way of thinking and most people rejecting the left, media, and Dems.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127003712/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199483038478012416): If your schools are indoctrinating everyone going through them like ours are, it's going to be tough.  Brexit is needed at bare minimum.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127003034/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199482279300665346): Trump can say something for all the world to hear and see, but then the media will blatantly claim he said the opposite, and along with Hollywood, and the lying Dems, this oft-repeated lie will simply overwhelm the airwaves, and become embedded in the public mind.
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127002954/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199480801710264321): There were people live-streaming there for days, and the Left were very aggressive and agitating the right who they outnumbered hugely. https://twitter.com/realChaim_Rubin/status/1199474256519876608
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127001855/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199479871275196416): It is very worrying.  Are you in New York now and are you planning on returning to London (which is very bad, especially with Sadiq Khan as Mayor, I hear)?
* [27 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127003710/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199478795423690752): Thank you.  I've gone through your tweets and replies as I said I would, and replied to all of your tweets to me, even though it was 1 day later. It was a pleasure.üòä
* [26 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127004223/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199477791965827072): Those missiles are nothing different.  Iran is the thing.  AS is growing all over the world.  The Jews will leave England, because of the growth of the Muslims, and the left.
* [26 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127000304/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199476886486822914): That's why I like Trump so much on Iran.  Iran want's to become the 4th Reich.  If the Dems get in before Iran is defanged, then they might become that.  Israel shouldn't have to do it alone, and without a Netanyahu, would they even have the courage?
* [26 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127000325/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199475901521694720): I'm very suspicious of patriotism.  That's one of my liberal leanings I just mentioned.   I believe that patriotism should largely be earned by the country. There is something to be said for defending the group that your part of, but I don't believe in defending us if were wrong.
* [26 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191127001546/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199474964539281409): I used to think of myself as the most liberal man in America. I was always political.  I still have some liberal leanings, but just a few.
* [26 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191126235901/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199474070380789760): Leftists kill people all the time. Many of the mass murders you mentioned are actually done by leftists, but the media spin it and lie. Black Lives Matter people black separatists kill the police frequently.  That was one guy with a car. Leftism killed 110 mil to the Nazis 12 mil
* [26 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191126234554/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199470478785761280): I'm afraid that I completely disagree.  We've never faced anything like the left before.  Listen to the Dem debates. They are going to open the gates and bring in the third world, most worryingly the Muslims.  And they'll virtually disarm the police and the Army.  I see it.
* [26 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191126234950/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1199468982669135872): I still say things have definitely been on the upswing for Israel.  I don't think they are getting more rocket attacks then they have in the past. Iran, and their proxy Hezbollah, and Iran's efforts to surround them are the big worries.

They were given Jordan, which I believe was larger than they were promised, plus a Palestinian state.

They already control much of the vote.  Starting in 2024, The Republicans are done...finished.  The purple states are turning blue.  Between the Hispanics, and the brainwashed young adults coming out of our school systems, the Left has won

They defend them and say that what they said was misinterpreted, or it wasn't antisemitic.  Their followers do not defend the concept of antisemitism.

I actually think it is likely to happen again (not the holocaust but the blatant bigotry) and all the Jews are going to have to end up in Israel.  But it will be from the left, not the right.

The media plays them up because they have always used the far right as a boogeyman.  I'm convinced they are just a tiny minority.   Charlottesville was a huge national "unite the right" event.

Ilhan Omar is the most hated person in this country.  When she does say something antisemitic, people either are furious or say it wasn't antisemitic. But they don't endorse antisemitism.

Look at what's going on there with antisemitism.  Maybe if they were free to criticize Muslims there like in the way that we are, there wouldn't be as much Muslim antisemitism there as there is now.
* [25 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191125075347/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1198869177878097922): I think your right.  Forget about us and our opponents.  The general public, as represented in social media, seems to prefer our arguments to theirs.  The bigger tweeters, like David Collier, have far more replies that agree with him than attack him.
* [25 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191125074549/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1198868352812355585): No. That should be considered egregious.

They were so powerful during the Nazi era that people still see their ghosts. I just don't see it at all.  They are so incredibly discredited, that they dare not even think those thoughts.
* [25 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191125073742/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1198867000560422913): Until I entered this discussion a few minutes ago, I thought that perhaps we were winning the social media debate on Israel.

It seems to me that we are killing any that challenge us.   Isn't it just as possible that the rise is due to other factors, like the growing influence of leftism, and the further distance from the Holocaust?
* [25 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191125072931/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1198863406981427201): Twitter is making its own rules. Some of which are stated, and others which are not.  We are not, on the whole, benefiting from those rules.

But they won't be.  In the environment we are in now, such laws and regulations will only help the left, and silence everyone else.

Just a wee bit, Hahahaha. Are you sure you didn't mean all of Zionist's enemies in the region?  I mean, substitute their enemies for Zionist in that sentence...doesn't that fit so much better?

(In Israels case, they go overboard). How jealous you must be, not just you but all of the Arabs, to have an advanced Democracy, with all of its benefits, right in the middle of you.

All they care about is that they think their opponent is weaker than them.  Women, children, the disabled, animals.  They don't see them as beings to protect.  Instead, they see them as beings to exploit.

The people who left have died.  The people who came to Israel then have largely died. Most of them were born in Israel there's nowhere for them to go.

You cannot discredit his incredible knowledge and arguments about Israel based on invented flaws; it wouldn't matter whether they were true or not. Plagiarism does not discount his work

You abuse them and make them leave, or you kill them.   The Jews, Christians, Kurds, Yazidis,etc. They are terrible bigots and violent about it. I'm sorry to say that to you.

In America, they didn't try that.  The host population accepted them and they all benefited from each other, a lot!

If the Arabs were empathetic and reasonable, they would have lived with the Jews and benefited quite a bit from them.  Instead, they wanted to crush them.

My point is that Arab culture doesn't have 1/10th the empathy of Jewish culture. So when they are in conflict, the Jews try to reconcile and the Arabs try to overpower.    Jews want to cooperate.  Arabs want to dominate.

I think they fear to debate anyone half good. I think the main reason for that is that they know their side is built on emotion and not facts.  I think they know that they're wrong, and they are afraid we will expose them

There are still a lot of people who still have their heads on straight.  I'm of the opinion that they see Trump as a great threat to their dreams of eventually getting to a leftist utopia.  They fear him for the same reason you and I see hope in him.

It's just that, so far, it has gotten much worse under him. He'll have to win again, and then do so frigging good, which is possible, that he brings everyone to his and the conservative way of thinking

I know I sound nutty, but I'm 99% sure we are finished, and very soon unless we can do that.

The very same thing is going to happen here, even more so than it has already.  When the Dems get the white house back, they are going to throw open the gates.

During the 1960s, they planned it all out, if loosely.  As time went on, they tightened it up.  The universities, especially, are now full-blown indoctrination centers.  Much more so than even 10 years ago.  I don't know what can be done?

What happened immediately after was that everything got suddenly worse.  Jack Trolled President Trump.  Their claims are meant for laughs.  They are not to be taken seriously at all.

They still have to be judged against others fairly. Everyone that excels has higher standards, but they still excel more than the others.

But it is entirely twisted to judge them more harshly than those behaving worse, simply because they may not be meeting their own higher standard. That'd be pathetic.

There were a bunch of Jew-haters that mostly AK and I were dealing with a couple of days ago...Not Israel haters but Jew haters, they got me upset for a while, but mostly because I wasn't used to them.

Having the President mock it and possibly bring the whole nation to reject it.  But I'm starting to see what others have been saying, about fearing his blowing up the entrenched bureaucracy.

Or rather, it is encroaching on all of them and having varying degrees of success. It won't be long, though.  They are coming out of the schools indoctrinated.

Obama pulled them very far left.  They were going to go there anyway. He just got them there about 5 yrs quicker, I would estimate.  They've taken over the schools.

Very few Christians really know the Bible, and Very few Jews really know the Old Testament.   Moslems get their cultural norms from the Mosques and from each other.

It doesn't have to say that in the Quran.  It is what was done. Islam is what Islam does.  The same with Communism or capitalism or any system.  What matters is what is done

They are largely living in makeshift camps anyway.  That has to come to an end. They need to move out and start a real life if there only other alternative is to stay in those camps and attack the Israelis.

He was the closest thing we ever had from the leaders the Pals end up with. He was widely rejected by Israelies, and most definitely by Jews outside of Israel.

Understanding and exposing the evil truths of Islam is a righteous duty.  All evil is to be exposed and where possible, confronted.  Islam represents a worldwide evil that is harming 100s of millions of people.

They always have and it's why they've been so opposed since the beginning.  Isreal threatens to expose Islam by comparison and by contrast.

You have atheist that reject Israel you have Jews that reject Israel none of those things alter the fact that the Arab Muslims rejected Jews having sovereignty in the land over them or beside them.

When you know you've been caught, you slip away and change the subject.  I made some tweets up. Here is the first of three: https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1196487922041729024?s=20

He shows how even Morris agrees that the Pals were not expelled.

A fight the Israelis dreaded and did not start and did not want.  The Pals, after the beginning, when they were winning, started to lose badly. only about 5% were expelled, out of self-defense necessity.

Benny Morris is hardly the only one that said this.

He specifically refutes your narrative.  He specifically said exactly what we have been saying and specifically disputes that they were expelled.  He says we wanted them to stay. We asked them to stay.

It may be seen as a general punishment against women, for being women, as it is anything else.  Comparing the two is almost like comparing an ear punctured for an earing to removing a brain tumor.

But when people insist on the value of freedom of choice of religion..or from religion...they need not justify it by proving that there is complete freedom within their chosen religion.

The world has come to expect selfishness from the Muslims, but good people do not except it.  Israel is a tiny sliver of land surrounded by Muslin land 1200 times its size. They wanted to live with you.  Now they may have to live w/o U.

You want everything for your evil people. Israel and the Jews never took from you.  It is you that want to take from the Jews. Why waste your breath trying to rationalize it and pretend it is the other way around?
* [15 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191115160918/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1195368401365094400): You are a German atheist, living in Germany?  Do I have that right?

* [15 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191115160955/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1195365536034705408): It is a threat and it does justify your position.

I was just wondering if we could stop them like we don't allow Iran to bring in weapons to Lebanon...which is a sovereign country.  But we don't do such a good job of it.   I just wanted to talk that out.  Thank you üôè

Could America take us in?  The Jews could only help Amreica.   Is this idea so crazy?  Can Israel survive long term as it is?

In fact, we need to do whatever it takes to make Israel more defensible that it is now.  As it stands, Israel is still too vulnerable and will probably need more land.
* [15 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191115152840/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1195358458989690881): Does it make any sense to give them their state but still do whats necessary for Israel's defense.   Very similar to right now but call it their state?
* [15 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191115152108/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1195357410711486470): You have nothing but evil in your heart

A state that incurs this penalty because of their aggression?  In other words, not much different than now but considered a state, and no longer part of Israel? I actually am ignorant about this.
* [15 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191115163002/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1195375875673542656): If they are offended against then they have a right to incur on the offender's land and build it.  The moral right to do so.

Would making it a state change things.  Would they be allowed to invite in Iran, Hezb, and Hamas just because they were now a state?
* [15 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191115145439/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1195351483858014212): Soemtimes yes.  Sometimes no..

The Pals stay on their side, but not the 67 borders.  You know that's not defensible.  It never was.  You have to have a sensible plan that doesn't feed Israel to the Islamists.  No Guarantees of security will be sufficient.  Use common sense.

The problem is that the Pals have internalized it.  They are not against it.  That is the problem. And of course the US or Israel could defeat them.
* [15 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191115142527/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1195345376221519872): Why is Israel at peace with their other neighbors then?

* [15 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191115141546/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1195343777818464257): Not in the way you would envision it though.  If they all reject them, WHICH THEY SHOULD, they wouldn't need to flee to Israel.  They would become part of Israel right there, or they would be Israel's friendly and successful neighbors.
* [15 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191115141546/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1195343777818464257): yes

* [15 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191115141529/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1195343054410043393): Israel has more than enough cause to take it all at this point and move them all out. Israel has reached that point decades ago, and they reach it even further with every provocation and attack from them. They won't live peacefully next to Israel, so why should they be respected
* [15 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191115142559/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1195342134523633664): If I were a Pal I would reject them with every cell of my being.  That's the honest truth, I swear on my eyes. I would escape to Israel and swear allegiance to them or something similar.  I would leave the Gaza strip.

If David and the Jews were rebelling it would be against evil and tyranny.    And I would be for him and apparently you would be against him.  The Pals are fighting for evil.  Not against it. You cant figure that out.

Even if Ben Gurion wrote that it doesn't mean he meant it literally,  It could be hyperbole or one of a hundred contingencies,   People say things that they don't mean by the hour.  By the minute.

You are believing the lies of a massive industry of lying about the Jews.  The Muslims got into that industry with gusto after the Zionist movement began.

All the Jews did was have a favorable ruling by the world court.  Attacking them was the height of bigoted savagery, and has been since the beginning.

Simultaneously, I don't know if you can identify a more repugnant response in human history as the response from the Arabs.

And there is a secondary one.  Both of those reasons are not normally part of the narrative, but both are true.

I also think that you are remarkably skilled at it and I find it very impressive.  If you were on the right side ie...our side, you would be one of our best I believe

It would be as if the anglo-americans were attacking the crap out of our Hispanic immigrants,  are the Europeans we're doing that to the Muslim immigrants.
* [14 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191114111616/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1194931602876502016): You're lying when you say it's about demographic threats. It's about the fact that the Palestinians were fighting and attacking the Jews and refuse to live with them. You're spinning it around as if the whole thing was planned and nothing happened other than carrying out the plan
* [14 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191114105609/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1194931156820647936): It's like you walk into the middle of a fight and you look at one side swinging and ignore the other side completely. That's not a way to analyze a dispute.

Taking in it's real context, you see that the Palestinians and the Arabs have been to blame for every single issue.

Is it so the tradition can be maintained, but more symbolically than literally?  Is it still harmful, and are there less harmful ways to maintain the tradition that exists, instead?
* [14 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191114043810/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1194832529032916993): Good lucküòä  As long as she is crushed again by the big guy.üëç

You are suggesting that the antagonism against FGM on young girls is because of lack of respect or antagonism against women. I just don't get it.  It's a protection of them because that procedure is more harmful.

She is dropping like a rock in the polls, by the way.  From the beginning, I guessed that Buttepege would be the candidate.  It's a long shot, but he is climbing. He's a loon, but super smart.

If the AA of P suggests doing something to one group because it is done to another group, that would only argue that left-wing stupidity is reaching the medical sciences.

It's not just in religion, though.  Weddings, funerals, military and patriotic rituals, all give respect and reverence to the way things have been done over the generations.

In this case, it is inferior, and we have better ways now, however, it became part of a religious act, and since Jews knew it wasn't out of perversion, some have been content to keep it, because of it being part of a religious act.

But their babies do get cut, scrapped, and injured. Animals do it then. They also do it for cleaning. This started thousands of years ago, and people learned a lot of things from animals then.

Why is little Israel so on their minds??  They say they are disgusted with its immorality...Really??? In this world, they are disgusted with Israels imorallity? Look at the UN?

The centrality of the Jews in world events, is beyond reasonable.  The inventions and creations of the Jews, 1/500 people on earth, is beyond reasonable.  There return to Israel, and their defeating 7 Arab armies, is beyond reasonable

But I believe that Jews are special and that the way that they are treated is special. I believe that many of the incredible predictions regarding them have come true.  Based on that alone, I wonder.

There may be some tension between a biblical interpretation, but as for their being a God-creator... those scientific theories do not rule that out.

It is not that alone, but other things as well. All of those things have to do with Jews and with Israel. Those are the things that I know about, and, collectively, they have made me really question my agnosticism.

Israel's enemies have zero respect for those laws and don't even contemplate abiding by them.  Israel, then, has no choice but to do the same.
* [13 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191113150730/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1194626628657115140): I think she probably means presented evidence, like in a news conference or presentation or a  hearing or something.  She is relying more and more on legal principles.  The thing is, Israel's enemies are attacking them in extra-legal ways-so Israel must fight back in that arena.

They are being held down because when they get up they start throwing bombs. They are being held tight, because when let loose they start charging and stabbing and shooting and driving over people.

In fact they are so poor that it may be possible to excuse much of what you say, because to me it least, your misunderstanding what is going on.

While at the same time ignoring and not acknowledging other things. The fact is Israel has stated that they carried out this operation to protect their own lives.

* [13 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191113143632/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1194572713030868992): It is not a firm belief. It is a fact accepted and known by everybody. It is a mathematical certainty. There are few if any similar situations in history where the much more powerful army tolerates such constant assaults from there much weaker enemy.
* [13 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191113115504/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1194571821045231618): They are not defending anything and you know it. They are attacking. They're not defending. What a joke to say they are defending. Just think about that. Israel is not marching in. The Palestinians are attacking Israel.
* [13 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191113123004/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1194571405263806464): There's no relevance of that question whatsoever?

Why would you advocate for  67 borders when you know that that's just a Prelude to Israel's destruction?

Did you ever ask yourself that?  Why do you accept this crazy idea that violence against Israelis is acceptable? If it won't accomplish anything , how is it acceptable?
* [13 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191113111320/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1194569895968694273): That's a beautiful shot.  Thank you.  Why won't the Palestinians make peace with Israel? Why would they rather put up with that just so they can continue to kill and wound Israelis?

International law, blah blah blah blah blah, none of that supersedes Israel's need to defend itself against incoming missiles.

As such Israel has the right to fight back and they are. So stop asking why and how. Gaza is Waging War against Israel and Israel is responding.
* [13 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191113113900/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1194564598663450624): He's following Yemen now like a puppy? That's incredible. I can tell you that they are not one in the same. They're two different varieties of jerks.

Everything that Hamas in the Palestinians are doing is wrong that's why they're in a sealed off space and that's why they're getting hit back. I think that they would be allowed to leave if they wouldn't try to come back with you know what

Let mean old Trump do it and take it off of Israel's blame.  And it would also frighten Hamas to think that Trump would dare to come in and step on them like that.

There is the chance of drawing in other superpowers, like Russia, for example.  I'm just kind of fantasizing out loud.  I'd just love to see it.

I never really understood why we never have actually helped that way (I know Israel doesn't want to and has never asked) but still.  Trump has already broken several precedents.

I blocked 1 person in the whole first year.  Since then, just folks I've been warned were "reporters" and Thales.

My feeling is that the recent rejection of mainstream religion has left a vacuum that Communism and Nazism filled, and presently it is being filled by leftism and Islamism.  Judaism and Christianity have been better than all of those.

Other costs are left out, like the cost of maintaining soldiers in those countries.  America does not maintain US soldiers in Israel.

All that America gets from Israel is hard to quantify, but what can be quantified is amounts to much more than we give Israel in military aid.

The Jews did not march in to the Gas chambers or leap into the ovens for any other reason than they were forced by the Nazis.  P.S.  The Bible, as well as other religious texts, are Awesome historical sources.

But not one individual, fundamentalist or not. But religions and their expression change over time.  Judaism is an ongoing thing, and the re-establishment of Israel is part of it.  But I'm expressing my loosely formed opinion only.

When you adjust for population numbers and percentages, this type of phenomenon shows up in many areas.

But sure.  BTW, I was saying from the beginning that you were a Jew in the Finklestein, Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky mold and people argued that you were not Jewish.  I was right.

* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111185906/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193965350175608833): How do you steal something the courts have awarded you and you've been militarily attacked for in an effort to take it away from you?
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111190206/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193964921983262720): Have they not always done that.  Can't you take your head out of your lying books and see what is real.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111185455/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193960900375515136): That was always the reason.  But more than strong and free.  Dominant and better.  Outperforming them in many ways.  That was always their nightmare.  I always thought that was behind their furious homicidal urges to kill or expel them
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111185338/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193963696780980224): The world must start pressuring the Gazans to accept Israel's generous offer of relinquishing their claims against the countries that expelled them. Those countries must take in the Gazans.  It is their moral and legal responsibility now, thanks to the generosity of Israel.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111185214/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193962196486807554): So call Gaza a country.  I'm ok with that.  A belligerent country that Israel will crush at the first threat.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111185347/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193961721439903745): You don't consider reality, reality.

The Jews are on thier last hill.  They have nowhere else to go. They have no choice left but to fight.  You cant have it.  Youll end up with a blood bath, and maybe become part of the surrounding Arab countries.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111184258/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193960033102508033): Minor details.  Lets not triffle with these side arguments.  The main thing is that Isreali Jews must relinquish there hold on there only little contry.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111184152/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193960536335142912): Israel will fight to the death to prevent them coming back and destorying Israel.  That is what you have left.  That is your proposal.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111184258/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193960033102508033): Israel wont take them back.  You have an offer, but your conter offer is to destroy Israel?
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111184043/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193958950028349448): What safe haven does he need.  He is the enemy.  The safe haven is needed from him.  Not by him.

Again, you refuse to acknowledge whatever you don't want to.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111183017/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193957940622958596): It's gone from 700,000 to 30,000 with walkers.

* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111183415/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193957043989831680): 1000 Percent Correct.  Gaza could, and should, have Flourished. https://twitter.com/A_Reality_Czech/status/1193934251386908675

* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111182243/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193955930548912130): There is now.  Get over it.  Your Muslims are moving into Europe, by the way.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111182256/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193955562549108736): There will come a time that Israel will withdraw this offer and the Pals will end up with less.  Maybe even lose their lives.  In the meantime they are living in tents for 3 generations now.  They are not coming back.  The Arabs are not going to fight and lose for them again.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111181925/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193954868815372289): You are giving it a tremendous fight but you can't win because you are so wrong on this issue.  You are.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111182907/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193954385937784832): Israel is not taking them back.  PERIOD.  At most, they'll take back the 30,000 seniors still living.  This is their best shot, and Israel, again, would be giving up so much!  But the Pals and the Arabs are impossible to deal with and so they are offering this, great offer.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111180330/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193950181202518016): You're full of it.  Israel had the writ of ownership.  They were surrounded by hostile Arabs.  They were without weapons in the beginning.  THEY DID NOT WANT A WAR WITH THE WHOLE ARAB WORLD.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111175552/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193949795649544198): Not even close to kidding

You keep talking about laws.  That was the legal way that those two countries were made.  Unlike most countries won by warfare, Israel was won by LAWFARE.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111180026/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193949055556210688): They are in tent camps now.  How is it forcing them?
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111175410/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193948879068303360): No say at all.  They are the luckiest bastards that ever started a war and then fled, and then refused to make peace to come back.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111175257/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193948563891470337): The Jews did not start a war with those countries Arabs.  They were kicked out on pure bigotry.  They owe Israel trillions and trillions of dollars
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111175108/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193948013691101191): They can't live with the Jews who they want to exterminate.  They can live with the Arabs who took the Jews' land and property and wealth.  That's the solution to the Israel Palestinian problem
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111180151/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193947399087120384): They have no real claim in the first place.  They should consider themselves lucky.  And they aint coming back to Israel: UN or not
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111175316/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193947098103865345): Thank you.  It is Brilliant.  It is Solomanesque.  It is a Trumpian.  All that is needed to figure out a way to turn the pressure away from Israel and onto those 9 countries...That is 9 whole countries that owe Israel big time.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111174557/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193946503536107520): Its a different time.  Things have progressed or rather stagnated.  They have no hope of coming back now.  The other Arabs are more friendly.  Trump is a crazy deal maker...
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111175608/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193946005693194240): The Jews have claim to those assets.  They should relinquish them in exchange for those countries for taking in the Pals of  Gaza.  We're talking 9 countries, with a lot of Jewish land and property.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111173831/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193944096978751488): The Jews have a claim on that land from which they were expelled.  The Jews can relinquish their claim, or transfer it to the Pals in Gaza.  The world should start pressuring those countries to use the land they stole from the Jews and give it to the Pals.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111173831/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193944096978751488): Why cant the solution to this thing be that the Arabs who kicked out the Jews, right at the same time as the Pals fled Israel, be pressured to take in those Pals.  They Owe Israel hugely.  They took their land and their wealth.  There are 9 countries that did that.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111173224/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193942485548052482): This is part of a disjointed but real idea.  I think this is a good idea.  Especially now that Josee rejected it out of hand. haha
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111165510/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193931670673612801): When Pakistan is way better than you, than you really need to reevaluate.  Imagine getting shown up in your humanity by Pakistan.

* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111163129/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193927344286785536): You know a lot more about the Bible than me.  But I still think they were probably not black.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111162533/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193927043798503425): That is a much better offer than they deserve.  It is too generous if anything.  It is the answer.  Another epiphany from yours truly.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111162023/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193925871389814784): I'm feeling stronger about it by the minute. It's Salomon esque read my proposal again I'm standing by it and your response is very weak
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111164613/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193924910986518530): Hello...  Those 9 countries expelled their long-lasting Jewish communities and took their belongings.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111161546/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193924153658740736): Right there.  Right there, in your answer to Ilanyvv, you were full of it.  If you believe it, you've lost all credibility to be a fair arbiter.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111162201/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193923722928898049): No no no.  It is related in every way.  My proposal is serious.  They owe the Jews.  The Jews are owed it, but Jews are very generous, and I believe they would offer their claim to the Pals, if for no other reason because the Pals are so frigging unreasonable.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111161940/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193922619529220101): Is that a big part of their thing?  Saying ancient Egyptians were white?  And weren't they??
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111155138/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193917790044000258): When you say looking down on each other you are just projecting a superiority in your own mind.  All waring tribes and entities look down upon each other in the grossest terms imaginable.  You can't go back in time and change history.  You can affect the present and the future.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111155608/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193917078153154560): I don't always mind being wrong, and I don't feel too bad about asking when I don't know.  I think of it as a conversation.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111154512/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193916262205808640): I don't trust what you are saying either.  I've learned to have much more faith in Dave French's point of view though.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111154606/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193915862803025922): I know little about it.  The problem with what you are saying though is that I've found you to be ideologically driven above all else, and in a leftist way.  I'm not saying your wrong, I just don't know and I don't trust your viewpoint.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111153658/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193914952312131584): If you say so then I'm inclined to possibly agree.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111153753/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193914617166217217): There is a difference?

* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111153535/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193914100444737541): Coming into a country can be a lot different than taking over a home.  You can have influences in a country. India is richer now than it would be without Britians influence.  Some of the worst barbaric practices of India were stopped by the Brits. I dont think its all bad I mean.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111153904/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193912600934920193): Maybe it's racist to blame the white man on black problems.  Why not talk about other black tribes and how they affected eachother?
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111153553/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193912187250708481): It is clearly and loudly noted that you avoided my scenario.

Influenced, affected, but not taken over. Has it been taken over in an exploitive way?  Where they were all worse off because the Europeans mistreated them?  If that is true, I might have to reevaluate.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111152913/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193909754327908352): Why you leftist?  If I don't know, there is nothing wrong with what I said.  Unless you are a racist leftist that is.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111152017/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193909422797598723): you paint the situation with a two by four and miss all the important details.  That's because you dont care about them.  Your only detail is they are Jewish and your side is Arab.  You then project that simple-mindedness on to them.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111152747/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193908872374898689): It is a very fair question.

I don't approve but it wasn't meant as a deep insult.  He has more than enough cause to say much worse about them.  But it wasn't to be taken so seriously.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111151121/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193907691925778433): I truly don't know anything about this, except I thought that Europeans have brought a lot of advances to Africa?  Plus bad things, but all told I think they were probably a net plus.  It is true, then they couldn't blame white people though, or Europeans.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111152424/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193906807359582209): I am not.  What's wrong with my brilliant fair, and Solomanesqe plan?

* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111145958/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193905688424173578): You don't know which end is up.

* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111150219/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193904038405967873): No, they lost that right, and it was too long ago anyway.  Move on.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111151107/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193903675900661761): The offer is they go to where the Jews were illegally expelled from.  That is cosmically and ethically just.  King Soloman himself would agree.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111150020/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193903186370805760): We are sorry, but it is a habit that we can not really overlook.  We are just funny that way.

They owe the Jews and the Jews can grant their due to the Pals.  They should be happy to live amongst their own since they can't abide the Jews.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111145918/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193901633542991872): No less, or more.

I don't think I ever heard you remark on the injustice of truly long-lasting Jewish communities being expelled from so many Arab countries.  The parallels are so obvious.  Your reticence to discuss them and argue for equal justice is blatantly inconsistent.
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111143525/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193899040234262528): I agree with him also.  It really is quite simple.

In response to the actions of the Arabs, who could question or judge or argue with what Israel did?  When a crime is being committed against you, actions that would be considered illegal in a vacuum can then be legal.

Nothing would be the same at all right from the time the holocaust survivors started immigrating there, and improving everything.

I could not withstand the slings and arrows.  Nor for 2 days even.  I would not be clear headed under those circumstances.  I would start to say things, that I didn't necessarily mean.  (Not that you aren't being sincere now).

Neither of us were there.  You know their are accounts that were much more favorable to the Jews than other accounts.  I really believe those.

The Arabs were always the criminal attackers.  That the Jews prevailed, (after much loss of life and limb, and property, and their natural right to serenity), doesn't negate their victimized status.

If a judge rules that a divorced couple split the house, the husband can't attempt to kill the exwife and take it all. The foundational crime, against the UN ruling, and against the Jews, is clear
* [11 November 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191111133205/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1193881723215454208): The foundational crime was by the Arabs against the Jews.   Everything that followed comes from that.  The Arabs must compensate the Israelis financially for the cost of that war, and for every war  after that they initiated.  Israel also has the right to sue them for damages.

Genocidal law breakers should rewarded, 70 yrs after the fact, and that those that followed the law should be uprooted, and their property transferred.

Those attacks do not facilitate the right of return and they're not intended to. It's absurd to suggest it and it shows lack of sincerity.

They can't take the world back to the 9th century. The left hopefully will still be in control of all the instruments of power especially the military and police forces when the two of them start to fight.

That's the only possible way your scenario would ever work out.  And why is it that you never talk about that essential element.

He says the same thing that I'm saying.  It's all about the left. The right has been thoroughly debunked. Now, after so much nonsense from the left, the right IS STARTING to grow.

If you're talking about college history books than I don't trust anything that they say.  They are written by ideologues concerned as much by creating new leftists as they are by teaching history.

He's willing to lie, like every single other Democrat candidate, but most of his expressed views are authentically his.  He's been at this for decades, and he is a true believer in nonsense.  Tha's why he's become a folk hero among the senseless.

I really think that white supremacy is a huge boogeyman used by the left. That it existed recently in parts of Europe and the west and almost took over the world is clear.  After the Nazis fell it has been so thoroughly discredited though.  Not so Islam.

I wasn't thinking of that angle, just that it was pathetic for Bernie to lie to himself about the nature of our enemies, ourselves, and the realities of Israel and its neighbors. That people like Bernie make it OK to support/condone antisemitism makes it even worse.

When someone can show me an animal that chose to be born as  an abused and severely mistreated piece of meat on a factory farm, only then might I  entertain the thought that they could possibly deserve it.

The left, joining forces with Islamists, as they unite to take down all of our institutions and our way of life.  It seems to me that they are succeeding.

Corporations, institutions, etc.  They are afraid to criticize an entity that has shown such a willingness to use terrible violence against their critics.

I've gotten my account interrupted and then asked to prove I was not a bot, almost a dozen times in the last couple of months. Each time after I prove I'm not a bot , they tell me to be careful and be sure to abide by Twitter rules???

There have even been many deaths caused by stones. But if you think the weapons they are using are so ineffectual, perhaps you could suggest to them they stop using them.

These people must be considered casualties of war, every bit as much as those that died on the field.  We can also reasonably assume that many times more are suffering in similar ways.

It's not guaranteed, but it is probably more likely than not.  Even if they were afraid too, a country like Iran with the ability to threaten with nukes would be so bad you would definitely recognize it, but by then it would be too late.

A second reason is good old fashioned antisemitism and anti-Americanism.  When, as of late, has Europe ever back the US, without resistance.

They have deserved empathy from the beginning, and the treatment they received from the Arabs has been anything but empathetic.  The Jews have earned the world's empathy.

Even if some pieces were close to the truth, the conclusion that you draw is beyond asinine.  Would the US even draw closer to Israel after 9-11 if it were true, as they did?  Everyone saw that we got even closer after that, Dr. Demented.

I'm also pretty sure it was mostly an offspring type of deal.  We got married and had kids.  Very little head removing or proselytizing of any sort.   So, no, it wasn't the same at all.

Weren't you creating enough misery on the Arabian Peninsula to satisfy your fascistic sadism? Did you really have to spread it all around?

In fact, unquestionably more than any other Arabs. The bigotted Arabs that have fought them from the beginning have caused untold misery for all involved.

That plan had a whole lot of Arabs living in the Jewish state.  The Jews agreed to this, and believe me it would have worked.

The reason the Jews wanted the partition was to defend themselves better against the hideous, racist aggression of the Arabs. The reason the Arabs wanted one state to share was that they wanted to continue that hideous racist aggression.  That's it.

There were only 750,000 Palestinians who fled Israel after the war they started with the Jews immediately after the UN voted for the partition began to falter.  That is less than the 850,000 innocent Jews who were expelled.

I took the place of America and protected that cat.  The savage child was the Nazis.  The heartless woman ex-owner was the Arabs, And the cat was the Jews.

The problem wasn't the Zionist movement, but the Arab Muslim bigotry that wouldn't accept a Jewish presence with any authority or autonomy there.

It's been a while since we have debated this and things got pent up.  It's hard to express things under Twitter's limitations.  I take back some of my accusations. I think you are wrong, not evil.

England stole their land or won it in a war.  They handed some to the Jews but almost all to the Arabs.  It was Arab bigotry that couldn't stomach it.  Pure bigotry.

They are attacking civilian Jews for no purpose.  It is pure evil.  There is no purpose or goal or strategic end.  It is pure antiJewish violence as an end in itself.

That's what Benny Morris said and after the vote for partition on November 29th that is exactly what happened.  You can't come up with theories after the fact trying to minimize the crimes of the Pals for what they did.

The Jews improve everything that they touch and the Arabs left plenty of room for improvement. I'm talking about human rights as well as advancements.  It was pure bigotry you call suffering.  You should be ashamed

No Arab was made to leave their homes.  It is gross that you accept such a scenario and seek to excuse it.  It IS GROSS!!!

'Deir Yassin, the single worst instance, was exaggerated by the Arabs and not corrected by the Israelis because they were happy to have it frighten the Pals into leaving.  One Holocaust was enough for now.

It is not murky and your side, while trendy, is not defensible.   Your side is 100 times worse, and you have chosen to defend it.

As they were complicit in a larger effort to exterminate the Jews by the 7 Armies who were gearing up for that purpose, the Jews encouraged some of the most complicit ones to leave. That differs markedly from your false narrative.

How can you, as a supposedly thoughtful person, defend this belligerency.

Did he think the Pals should have, with the other Arabs, massacred the Jews?

Why are you, a supposed liberal, taking the side of the tyrants against the side of the meek? Just because the meek finally fight back and win, that doesn't change who are good and who are evil.

It has pronouncements and teachings for and against everything under the sun. The rule that Islam has adopted is that the more recent doctrine supersedes the earlier ones. In Mohammed's later years, he corrected all that was peaceful with the opposite.

It is only the might of the West that has put an end to that where it could.  Youre cries of victimhood are as false as they are obscene.

That's why you are getting everything wrong.  A occupation is an act of aggression. In Israel's case, it is the Palestinians, and their Arab backers, who are the aggressors.  Israels singular interest in Palestine is defensive.

I thought that he would have taking it upon himself 2 stop using my likeness or anyone else's but it's been 3 days in a row now.

They do it in the name of Islam.  That's why almost all of the terrorists are Moslem.  It's not just a coincidence as the left-wing media would have you believe.  That they have been successful in convincing us is shocking

If you create a list.   say of antisemites, and make it private, when you go on that list you will see there tweets as if you are following them.

Zionism is not what is going on Zeno.  Zionism is what brought them there.  The engine is off, the headlights are out, and the bus is parked.  They are home and they are Israelis.

That is exactly right.  Very well said. The treasonous Dems turned against the war almost immediately after they voted to go in. Similar to the Vietnam disaster

They were building Nukes before the Jews destroyed them.  They used massive amounts of Gas on the Kurds.  They attacked Kuwait and threatened the Saudis.  It should have been done much cleaner, and with much fewer casualties.

That is not honest.  2nd, the plan was to kill as little as possible and get the job done. It was the Democrats that limited Bushes involvement that led to the successful resistance that ended up causing way more death, & destruction

They were involved in several wars against Israel.  Sadam paid for the murder of Jews. They started a war with Iran that caused about 1 million casualties.  He had rape and torture camps.

But even if what you claim is true, the fact is that a group emigrated there, the Arabs treated them murderously, and the UN stepped in and separated them.

I don't want to say more because I haven't studied the subject.  But I think there are different subgroups if you will.  The Ashkenazi Jew, at least, can be defined as an ethnicity.

It is hard to argue with a beautiful woman, especially when they show grace, as you do. But the Pals should have attacked Britain and the UN, if anyone, and not the Jews.

It was in response to Thales' continued assault agains "Zionism"  What do you think of it?   You know, I never, ever thought of us as Zionists until I came to this thread.

That is one of my famous lines after all...  This idea about them using the concept of Zionism against us...that it evokes a state of 'returning'...as if it is ongoing and therefore can be reversed.

The Zionist movement is completed.  It is in our wonderful history.  But it has been a great success and it is done.  We are Israelis now.

I don't think we should think of ourselves any longer primarily as Zionists, because we have returned and now we are Israelis.

Everybody sucks there and Don't have much of an opinion.  I like the Kurds and now Assad is helping the Kurds.  He's also protecting the Christians.

Now, If Assad leaves, it might be even worse.  For one thing, the Christians and other minorities in Syria would probably be massacred.

It would be a horrible war.  His way of motivating there own people to over throw the Mullahs is the best possible way.

How is it possible?  And yet it is happening. You are certainly right about "progressives" being the worst offenders.   Our first order of business should be to take that ridiculously misplaced label away from them.

Many of these same people still maintain that Jews capture and kill children to use their blood in religious rituals, in the preparation of Passover bread for instance.   I just can't comprehend this kind of nonsense. pic.twitter.com/35lRwAht2O

I wonder if this dumdum could actually be ex-UN Ambassador Susan Rice, in another hair-brained scheme, pretending to be Nikki Haley?

Could it be that God's hand has guided us to use that name, so that we may recognize our own, and in turn, its, callous ineffectiveness? pic.twitter.com/CpUGZAS8Fs

I know this because the Palestinians have wounded or killed their own, and the World Press has blamed Israel for it, countless times already.  It is a sick dance of violence, lies, and antisemitism. https://twitter.com/Bob12958595/status/1188149578262032386

You can guarantee that Israel absorbs some major casualties before it begins any counter assaults. Maybe the final outcome will even be different. It is a shame we didn't have someone as fairminded as you leading the Israeli defense back then.

Imagine my surprise to find that you are an actualy Nazi-like antisemite. That discredits you, though. It shows your not looking for truth.   No one was kicked out and no land was stolen. The Jews earned their sovereignty, more peacefully than Arabs ever have.

The Arab population was sparse and shifting.  Turkey lost a war and lost the right to call all the shots.  Thu UN gave Israel sovereignty.  No one was kicked out of their homes or towns.

This is not a jump ball situation.  This was settled, by the World Body first, and then when the Arabs didn't respect that it was settled by war of annihilation against the Jews. Like with other countries, it's done.

Of course, some of them will use anything, and those people will also twist it and alter it until it doesn't even resemble the kernel of truth it started out as.

There is something about your profile pic that looks like Thales.  I thought I was responding to him.  This is why a believe in more distinctive profile pics.  I really do.

I've noticed you are getting increasingly clever and funny.  Plus, I'm naturally paranoid.  I know that you are complimenting me, but I'm not sure if there is a grin on your face at the same time.

And they were quite brutal and engaged in torture and gratuitous murder.  At least I've heard that.  Do you think it is true?

Ireland is a white Catholic country though.  They already had a leg up from other places where Englands influence had a bigger and more positive impact.

So much of it though is just because we have all the facts and all the morality and ethics on our side.  I wonder how well we would do taking their side?

We are a very, very, beneficial country to the world, right now.  I'm willing to argue that.   I didn't take your leftist classes teaching about the evils of the west throughout history.   The USA is great now.

I do know that none of them are important to us and they are all probably more of a drag against us.  I know P. Rico is one big expense for us with not much in return.

I'm no expert on it but I wouldn't be surprised if our historians made us look a lot worse and the Indians a lot better than was actually the case.  But I'll concede we were rotten to them.

We raised up the quality of life in every conceivable way. I'm sick to death of people saying nothing but bad things about us.  Compared to who, I ask?

What is it with you English white people who have lost all confidence and are swimming in so much misplaced guilt?  White people have been the very best thing that ever happened to the Human race.

I lot of the conflicts we have been in have been altruistic.  A lot of them.  We are unusual in that regard and should be praised for that.  England was similar.  The white Anglo Saxons have been a blessing to this world.

As far as blaming another country, the answer is yes. There are plenty of very shitty countries all over the world that might benefit from your criticism. You are welcome to start with the M.E.

If Trump gets a second term he might go a long way in reversing it though. He may even be able to bring blacks back into the Republican Party. It was FDR, and the New Deal, that pulled them away.

Or, absent a connection where the academics are directly affected, there at least should be some consequence for their mistakes.  Reputational, if not financial.  It seems as if there is none.

All we do is think and argue and try to come to the best solution.  This isn't our fault.

You didn't. He's handsome.  You aren't as much. You should target someone easier.  I, in fact, would be a much easier target. You remind me of the Arabs attacking Israel.

One of my theories is that Mohammed was bested by the Jews, as well as rejected by them.  He felt humiliation in comparison to their rabbis and scholars.  He wanted them subdued, or dead.  I think the Moslems have internalized that.

They live alongside people who would love to make that happen.  Instead, like the raccoon with rabies I referred to earlier, all they can do is imagine the Israelis dying in their claws.

Almost half of the world's Jews live in Zionist Israel.  Most Jews outside Israel support it. Most Israelis have to enroll in the military.  And all Israelis are vulnerable to in its wars.

The big powers like the US can profit off of wars that don't touch them.  Israel is not in a position to profit off of wars that do not touch them.  Indeed, Israel's very existence is at stake.

The smart ones,  the lucky ones...they are enjoying the fruits of the Jews.  The ones that left so the Arabs could make their tomato soup out of the Jews...they are enjoying the fruits of the Arabs.

I don't even know where literature exists that actually says that  Israel's economy is based mostly on funding from the USA, Germany,  England, and France.

They were the victims of a genocide.   As for Jews leaving Israel to return Europe,  I don't know where you're getting that, but it can't be a large number.
* [25 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191025123119/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187694844782764037): "Without enemies, Israel would not be able to maintain it's wars?"   Tiny Israel, surrounded by enemies... it's very existence threatened, it's very existence has always been threatened, does not want enemies and does not want wars.

I don't know why that would be, but it seems like it may, in fact, be. The Bible tells us that this will be the case, and as with other predictions regarding the Jews, and their homeland , it has been borne out.

* [25 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191025011534/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187534300868235264): About 5% of them were.  In areas where they were giving the Jews a lot of trouble. Violen attacks and ambushes etc.  The others left on their own. This is accepted as the history by most.  Even liberal Benny Morris holds this view.
* [25 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191025010147/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187532793603153920): They let the Pals live.  The Arabs did not let the Jews live when they won battles.  They executed the Jews.

The next reason is that they were frightened for their own safety.  Israel was winning.
* [25 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191025005939/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187529948577390595): I'm very surprised you don't know this.  This is all well known.  The Arabs told the Pals to leave on the one hand.  They were going to come in and turn the Jews into tomato soup.  They wanted the women and children and civilians out of the way.
* [25 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191025010054/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187529275110543360): The Arabs were rioting.  Attacking both Jews and British.

They did not expel them at the beginning.  95% left on their own, primarily out of loyalty to the broader Arab world.  Israel just won't let them come back.  That's different than expelling them.
* [25 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191025004208/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187527635896864769): The British were governing Palestine when the Jews were trying to escape Europe and come there.  The Arabs didn't want anymore to come and were quite violent in their resistance.  The British then decreed that only so many Jews could come in( 75,000 )?and then blockaded Israel.
* [25 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191025003635/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187525936897515520): The credit goes completely to Israel.  Their decades-long existence on this earth would have not been quite as long if were any others they were in conflict with.  Look what happened to them in Jordan.

They should be expelled to Jordan, Syria, and Egypt.  The fact that the Israelis let this continue is a human rights disaster.  Against Israel.
* [25 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191025002856/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187522475908911104): I wish you knew the truth.

The world watched as the British left, The UN                              voted for the partition and for Israel's little bit of sovereignty, and the Arab nations marched to Israel and Attacked.

Why...because the Arabs wouldn't live peacefully with the Jewish immigrants.  (Do you have immigrants where you are?  Are they being so badly attacked like the Jews were?)  After the division, in which no Arabs had to move, they started the war
* [25 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191025000956/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187519384308330498): His point sounded true.  It did.  I think the Arabs tried to humiliate the Jews.  The reason the Arabs felt humiliated is because they are so macho and because they insisted on belittling the Jews.  So when they lose they are quite embarrassed.

Those Sephardic Jews became Israelis.

They are in that situation for the same reason that there is a blockade.  They insisted than as they do now on killing their neighbors instead of thriving with them.  Or even just living with or next to them.

The Stern gang came about to defend the Jews against the innumerable attacks by the Arabs against the desperate, starved, tortured and what was left of the mass murdered Jews.  They came into the Pals anything but welcoming arms, and then the Stern gang was created.

I can't at this moment devote the attention it needs to straighten out your thinking.  I hope we can continue later.   The Arabs should have accepted the Jewish immigrants.  It was pure bigotry that prevented them.

It has crossed over in to terrorism many many decades ago. And you know the these attacks aren't going to accomplish anything other than sadistically hurting Jewish people. There is no other purpose.

He is in all the conversations but by blocking me I can't see half of it.  It's been two months.  If he wants I just won't reply to him anymore.  I'm sorry for being rude to him.  I am.

It's like the leftists who were super critical of Vietnam and then Iraq.  But in a way, I think I agree.  What they definitely do is ignore the other side.  They ignore the wrongdoings of the Pals etc.

In the UK, I recently read that the Jewish population was .03%, or 1 of every 333 people.  My comment was about people defending Israel on Twitter though.  There are more Israel defenders than critics.  (With our group anyway.)

But we are in defensive mode.  We are simply defending against obscene, stupid, and racist attacks.   Also, my lady, I've been more than delighted to realize that many of our best defenders aren't even Jewish.üëäüëä

WHY  DON'T  YOU  DO THAT‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì

The Pals will not give it to them. They don't want occupation and conflict.  They DO NOT NEED US Money or WAR MACHINES. They need peace.  THEY NEED DECENT F...ING NEIGHBORS. But instead, they have what they have.
* [24 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191024100453/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187304348176527360): Words.  Are words more important to you than everything and anything else?  Those people you speak of are warring with Israel.  The one group over another that you talk about it true.  The people in the territories are treated differently.  But they insist on it.
* [24 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191024095320/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187303287466409990): You are exhibiting mental illness.  Seriously.

They have within their own country millions of Palestinians.   The reason they are behind a wall and have to go through checkpoints and such is that they are at war with Israel. Understand?
* [24 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191024093634/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187300308692754437): Israel is a democracy under siege.  Can we move on now to Iran, Syria, Iraq, Saudia Arabia, or Turkey?  Let's attack them.  How about that?
* [24 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191024093414/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187299513356169222): We have leftists in the US who may be even worse.  This has not always been the case but we have 1/2 the country that has fallen very, very rapidly into leftist madness.   They are at absolute war with anything practical or real.  Leftism is madness that insists on make-believe.
* [24 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191024091742/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187296576517087232): Israel is a war.  They are doing an unbelievably awesome job of taking care of their citizens and respecting their rights while at the same time trying like hell to keep them safe against their racist, antisemitic, religiously fundamentalist, hyper-violent neighbors.
* [24 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191024093414/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187299513356169222): Your such a twit.  Israel is not defective.  Israel is very EFFECTIVE.

You do realize that even the purest of democracies have stipulations for changing the rules somewhat when they are forced to.  When they are at war, or in a state of emergency.  I'm talking about Marshal law.
* [24 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191024091606/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187292949765328898): Tell me Zero, why do you focus on a country that carries such a burden, and yet is still able to delivery democracy and freedom to its citizens.  There are so many countries that are anything but inclusive, or democratic, or free, and they aren't dealing with lethal enemies?
* [24 October 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191024090406/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1187290641342062598): Israel is not a theoretical model for a bunch of graduate school classroom students to formulate into a model of democracy.  It is a real place with real people dealing with really lethal enemies.

But what makes you think that inclusivity is the most important thing for Israel to be?  Israel is the one and only Jewish state in   in a world where until recently they have been exiled and severely persecuted in their exile.

It is possibly criminal to slander private citizens that way.  People have to be protected from public humiliation. defamation of character, and false charges.

The guy with the red shirt has a smile that looks more friendly than menacing. The black guy on the left is almost certainly laughing. With nothing more than a photo, one can only make guesses.

You may get some interesting responses to it.  On the other hand, it's a little concerning that he went to the trouble to dig it up and then post it.

You, and those leftists like you, have built a make-believe world and you hate those that won't pretend with you.
