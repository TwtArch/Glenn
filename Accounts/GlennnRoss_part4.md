Things have changed quite a bit and that will become very clear this coming November.

Not an offer that anyone...ANYONE...would accept.  I mean anyone, including the Europeans and the Russians.  It would be too outrageous even for those guys.

We are in an informational age now where the lies are amplified through the use of technology.

After 70 plus years, the Arab world is tiring of maintaining it. The truth is starting to come out, after so much bloodshed and tears.   Let's all just stop with the nonsense, and live in peace.   #ThePalestinianLie .   #فلسطين_ليست_قضيتي

But  "Retweet' already means that you 'Like' it and clicking on both just creates duplicate Twitter clutter, or (Twutter).😎 I wish we were just given the choice of one or the other.  What would you change on Twitter?

Well, that's obviously an overgeneralization.  But it is 1,000 times more true than it is from country music fans. https://twitter.com/Colt_45_Outlaw/status/1259181864985792512

That's why good people must work together to reject this backward, fascistic, genocidal, misogynistic, slavery endorsing ideology.

At 6ft 3" tall, If 243 lbs is correct (which I doubt), that really isn't so heavy by today's standards.  But it would be reassuring if he did lose at least 25 to 30 Lbs.  (Easier said than done).

We are allowed to say that our President is a racist and an antisemite. Our government and political leaders say it all the time--the outrage of them doing so seems to escape them.  Unlike  Trump, Spike Lees IS a racist and an antisemite.

Only you know what you are referring too.   I see tweets all the time that require clicking on them for context.  But when you do click on them they are shown in context.

Muslims get away with murder in Europe, and the police (brass) are loath to confront them.

This time, the focus is on Joe Biden.  Hypocrite, Thief, Flip-Flopper, Con Man, and self-entitled Sexual Assaulter. https://twitter.com/DanFined/status/1256013581134544898

Really just a very smooth con artist.  He would just fill it up that shell in a way that was politically favorable to him. Until the last few years, he had been quite good at it, and it earned him and his family a fortune.

The very lack of other people within hearing distance of President Trump's words doing it only makes that point.

Jews are a blessing to any country, in a very big way.  A quantification of it would reveal the truth and accuracy of this, without doubt https://twitter.com/h7n33n/status/1255978490043805696

So here is an example where the left (the ones that believe in science and reason🙃) claim that a group that is the least in something is actually the most in something. There are many more examples like this.

Jews (not enough) have a special feeling for Israel for such obvious reasons that you would have to be a monster and an unreasonable bigot to not understand and agree with that.

As a whole they create more wealth, and Industry, and jobs than anyone else does.   They create less crime then almost anyone else also.  They are a net positive, in almost every measurable way.

Since when do the Palestinians or their champions care about justice?  All I have ever seen from them is bigotry, supremacism, resentment, and a willingness to engage in violence.

I remember what happened after the Arabs failed to murder, torture, rape and rob the Jews who largely came from the fires of the European Holocaust.  9 Arab countries did just that.

You are actively ignoring the mountains of evidence to the contrary.

From what I saw in that history, I believe that Trump will get between 34 % and 44% of the Jewish vote.  I also believe that Jews will donate less to the Dems than has been the case.

The media doesn't even discuss Sanders's anti-Israel stance, or his voting history, or his associations with people like Sarsour.  Trump will have everyone talking about it.

The death toll, including both military and civilian, is estimated to be about 3,000 Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis, as well as 64 foreigners.

It was the least of what was to be expected of the Israelis at that point but that changed long ago.

Bringing the Ayatolla back was a huge move by Carter, but it can be argued that cumulatively Obama won that contest.

I know that it says you can view the tweets if you choose to, and I think that the restricted account can not tweet but they can use DM.

These libels have almost always been the catalyst to cruel and wholly unwarranted violence against Jews.

There was no real issue for a Jew being a Democrat up until Jimmy Carter. Since Obama, it has really gotten bad.  Jews have largely become secular humanists.

I am taking comfort in the knowledge that in 10 years 95% of Jews will be Republican or Independent.

The Irgun and Stern were fighting in a hot war, for a desperate cause, with real achievable goals in mind.  It's not the same as blowing up and killing random Jews for no reason and for no benefit.

Men die younger and die more from activities, like all that you mentioned.  They have a lower life expectancy, but not a different fatality rate, overall.  If you look at an individual age group, then yes, men will have a higher fatality rate for that age group.

I'm considered a RW Jew and I support everything Israel but I'm really not sure how you could be getting this one so wrong.

They are supported morally, financially, and militarily. Donald Trump is the only one that seems to have the sense to see how crazy that is.

But this problem has nothing to do with White supremacy, sanctuary cities, Donald Trump, or drugs.  This problem is the same problem America has been facing since the 1960's, and we aren't allowed to talk about it. https://twitter.com/CristyFairy67/status/1211396561781116928

I still wouldn't be for them coming back 70 yrs later, though. The idea of fighting forever is ludicrous.   But the story of Israel is hardly them coming as conquerors. More the opposite

What needs to be done is to use parole more judiciously.  They've been using it as the default way of handling criminals.  This business of catch and release of repeat offenders is madness though.

Many Jewish Israelis are just that: Jewish Israelis.  They were not involved in the planning or creation of Israel. 2. Zionism has been just the quest for Jewish self-determination. 3. For no one has it ever been as necessary.

The rest of their dogma, covering other areas of life, are equally as destructive.  Islam needs to be completely reformed, or even eradicated.  Until then, no one that comes within its grasp is safe.

How in the world does that protect the public?  If they keep repeating, then they should just be kept in instead of going through the effort repeatedly and subjecting everyone to their criminality. https://twitter.com/michellemalkin/status/1211490409580335104
