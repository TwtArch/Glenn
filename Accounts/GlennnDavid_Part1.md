Except that there is a whole lot of lying going on.  So I just try to gather as much information as I can (including the fact that so many are purposely lying and exponentially more are just passing along the lies they themselves have been told).

The right amount of force is the amount that it takes to stop your attacker.  It's a very simple formula that everyone knows deep down and on every level.  Less than that is not enough and more than that starts to be gratuitous.  It's obvious.

It is a well-known fact.  I've heard returning soldiers talk about it.  I've seen tweets about it.  I've read articles about it.  It is well known. And your callous comment about the camels makes my point.

Firstly, criticism of Israel is not written into U.S. law as anti-Semitism.  Secondly, even if it were, it doesn't stop anyone at all.  Thirdly, that would be U.S. law, not Israeli.
