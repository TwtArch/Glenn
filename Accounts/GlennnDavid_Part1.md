Except that there is a whole lot of lying going on.

And they didn't put them through the normal process.  Far from it.  That's fine for emergency use, like for the elderly that were so vulnerable, but why are they pushing them so aggressively on the nonvulnerable.  & Why hide the problems?

The right amount of force is the amount that it takes to stop your attacker.  It's a very simple formula that everyone knows deep down and on every level.  Less than that is not enough and more than that starts to be gratuitous.  It's obvious.

It is a well-known fact.  I've heard returning soldiers talk about it.  I've seen tweets about it.  I've read articles about it.  It is well known. And your callous comment about the camels makes my point.

Firstly, criticism of Israel is not written into U.S. law as anti-Semitism.  Secondly, even if it were, it doesn't stop anyone at all.  Thirdly, that would be U.S. law, not Israeli.

I think cell phone cameras, security cameras, the internet (where these pictures and videos can be posted and distributed), and alternative news, (Fox, Newsmax, Daily Wire, etc) are what have changed.

The mafia keeps order, which is far preferable to chaos.   The mafia is bad, but there are things that are worse, and I'd prefer them to those things.

It's about stopping the leader of the free world from embracing cultural Marxism and spiraling out of control, with the whole world going down with it.  It's about changing the rules of engagement to match those who scoff at playing fair.

Israel can't stop 100% of incoming from the Palestinians, but the Palestinians can stop 100% from them! You doubt me?  It is 100% effective! It's so simple too!

I am just asking the question. One thing, though, just because it's the Islamist goal doesn't mean that we have to be against it. What's best for us is what's best for us.

If enough decide to ignore the laws, as they have been doing, then the laws become meaningless.  Or they only are used against us, and not themselves.  That is what has happened.  The Democrats have just decided to ignore or reinterpret them.

But compared to the status quo, is it really?  Israel is tiny and their enemy's weapons will continue to grow more powerful.   Eventually, all of Israel's enemies will likely have nukes. Think about that.

It's psychological and sociological and political.  It's not intellectual as far as I can tell. But of course the result is the same, if not worse.

They are MSM people, and they follow the leader. If he mowed down 10 of them as they were running away and the media and the Dems told them that it was justified, they would go with that.

Why do they see racism where it is not, and at the same time not see it where it clearly is?  They seem to be mentally living in the 1940's...or what their idea of the 1940's was like.   They're living in the past, while ignoring the present.

To start off with, can you murder someone by accident?  Is is still called murder in that case?  What I'm getting at is I don't believe for 1 second that he wanted to murder him in front of all those people and cameras.

In cases where the police are at fault, they should be dealt with accordingly.  I'm much more concerned that the police are getting injured and killed because of overly indulgent policies toward the thugs.

But I certainly don't miss him, and neither do his victims of the past or of the future.   He was abused, and he died because he was pretty much dying at the time that his abuse happened.  I think he's still be alive, though, if this hadn't happened.

This guy that Nancy is sicking on MAGA seems very much like a Grand Wizard of the KKK.  Just with new targets.    I do not like what I have been seeing.  The Dems are proving to be authentically bad, and we may be in for quite a shit storm. https://twitter.com/RepMattGaetz/status/1362523726424727561

He is now unleashed, liberated, free to say what's true and what is not!  He is a private citizen, who was recently the President and now knows EVERYTHING.

To me, it kind of brings to mind the Tanya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan story.  I see Kamala as a Tanya Harding type. Only more dangerous in every single way. pic.twitter.com/C2GVOf0J6R

Now the reverse has occurred. The Dems have essentially coppied the Nazi's fake attack on their own Congress. ‚ö†Ô∏èüò°

That is not the reason people are rallying behind her though.  They are rallying because they see a fighter who is going to give it right back to these criminals, and do so with class.

Since then I've heard many on both sides agree that she is just awful. After hearing from her and Dinesh Desouza, I'm proud to say that I think she is Awesomeüëä and she gives me some hope for the future. pic.twitter.com/EMEX70D2PM

Biden seeks to stop all that nonsense and get things back to normal.  üò°ü§î
