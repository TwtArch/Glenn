If she were only smarter she could cause some real damage.  But she seems like one of the dumbest members of congress to me.  Way dumber than AOC. https://twitter.com/WarNuse/status/1195093019457970177

And that's what he tried to turn CIA into after the evil anti-American President Obama appointed him to lead it. https://twitter.com/FiniteChances/status/1211651425194741760
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200107170541/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211651831941795846): This guy gets clobbered on the head during a legitamate demonstration for black civil rights. And somehow because of that he is elected as a congressman and for decade upon decade, from that perch, he spews his leftist, racist nonsense all over the American People. https://twitter.com/Johnpdca/status/1211441369312636928

Bad antisocial behavior is tolerated and defended because the power structure is illegitimate and those being punished are being treated that way largely because they are mostly Black or Muslim or Hispanic

As that control strengthened, California declined in every way.   I imagine Trump will highlight the Dems ruining of California in his presidential campaign.  I hope he does as it will be very, very effective. https://twitter.com/Education4Libs/status/1211449694435659777

It is also dangerous to whole countries and to the world.  That the left is advocating for that ignorance (yes, they argue that we should be ignorant and ignoring of it) is so destructive and it will lead to our own destruction. https://twitter.com/genuke1/status/1211639266897547264

I wish it were legal for good heroes like him to be carrying and ready all over this country and the world to defend the innocent from the evil. https://twitter.com/CalebJHull/status/1211503024255971330

I don't think that was your meaning.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191230124046/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211628192299130883): @Joseetje3 @zionistpsycho2 @david_starof @4ugust086 @TopRantKing @marcus124m @ilanyvv @HebMacMan @dlsmith0817 @shez19833 @Street_2612 @slax43 @qtr_uk96 @iluvdemocracy99 @BoomerangTime @Steven495 @ladyalmagreen @RuruRola73 @MaozSuzanne @fruitbatoo @Phucgnu @Joseetje1 @AlanEdw58236339 @iyeguda @BeerBaron14 @Talal9409 @HARBDARREL @SpykerDarkiss @puppylove8188 @QtrUk96 @scopevale @shoozer12 @cairn41912989 @coaxialcreature @NedalAlkhair @nachal_giyus86 @ErezNeumark @55thparallel @myfootballfacts @bifmit @BoomTown85 @LuanaGoriss @Levi_Genes_ @Claudet44422395 @Hasbara_Bob @DavidFr67827983 @Matzly @Jaccal68 @alle_vote @kol_Hakavod Good.  They deserve it for putting Israelis in a similar type of cage.  100,000 percent.

I've no doubt he's left a trail of suffering as he has moved through life, and whatever the reason he should be confined for the rest of his life as justice for his vicious assault on innocents. https://twitter.com/FiniteChances/status/1211623215790874624
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200106144749/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211625815684857856): Fuckelberry is a lunatic himself.

Collective punishment is the way nations have dealt with each other since the beginning.  It is only the Israelis and the Americans that have been searching for other ways.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200111054327/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211622749464084480): Any zoo animal would give half their years to be transferred from a Palestinian Zoo 2 an Israeli one.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200109152617/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211621531685736448): I don't know why the IDF would bomb is so unless there was a military reason. Or it was an accident. or maybe to save the animals from their horrible life given to them by the negligent and cruel Palestinians.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200108181302/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211621056995303425): That is antisemitic.

* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200104003101/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211619673462194178): You're a hundred percent right Josie. I don't like reporting and I don't think people should be reporting each other unless it is for some truly egregious Behavior. Expressing opinions is rarely egregious Behavior.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200114131921/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211619045256187914): I just figured out did you are the same person with a different Avatar. I would be happy to get a DM from you.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200103215257/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211617825384812544): Wikipedia has some information that is correct. Of course it does cotain a lot of information that is correct. But also a lot as false and it's true that it can be manipulated by anyone. All is true at the same time.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191231200537/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211617078123409408): I am also unaware of what the doctrine says. If the doctrine says that they cannot use weapons to protect themselves against people with weapons then the doctrine is wrong. that would be a prescription 4 their disappearance from the world. I don't think God would have wanted that https://twitter.com/terMercurius/status/1211525057060724736
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200101164519/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211616033796231169): I love this guy Dr Hagee☺ he fights evil and is a great friend of the Jews!

* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200103064814/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211614399582093315): There's no reason not to do that. Especially the retweeting. If you can tweet something there's no reason why you shouldn't retweet it unless it's in a conversation and wouldn't make sense if you retweeted it.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200113162933/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211612892862304256): These Palestinians should be prohibited from keeping animals either in a zoo or as pets or as livestock. They have shown themselves to be consistently negligent and cruel. https://twitter.com/TopRantKing/status/1211588761370451968
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191231035210/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211611173004742658): It also seems to me the David is always aiming for the truth, unlike you.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200109192005/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211610855391006730): That's a little strong, and a little bit too absurd, even for you to say. I know that some of the things that you say have some truth, if you separate certain sentences from there paragraphs that is.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200113224532/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211609208191430657): He  was aware of his actions and the evil of them.  He drove from the city to this synagogue in another city and went in with a big hideous machete and started stabbing and slashing at Jewish people celebrating Hanukkah. He knew his actions were evil and he ran and drove away. https://twitter.com/MiriamSafta/status/1211593155570753536
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191230071226/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211452227795259394): I don't even know if they allow it or not maybe they do    Religion is much more than the text. It's the interpretation of the text that matters and homosexual child sex is not allowed now.  Their is a problem with priests and children.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200113170134/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211450082282934274): Those are like mosquito bites compared to being chewed up by a whale. The me-too movement could only take place in a more advanced Society you guys are 500 years away from a me-too movement
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200109122515/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211449635023335424): I'm happy to compare everything.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200108135253/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211449452743086081): You can't simply say it's forbidden in Islam that excuse has been debunked a thousand times there's a lot of rape going on. There's a lot of one day marriages to children.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191230034450/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211446854203908098): Yes.  That's is a good summation of what I'm saying.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200108023157/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211446516797317121): the child abuse and rapes are 300 times worse.  And I'm talking about Jews vs Muslims.  I don't like attacking you guys.  But you attack Israel which behaves so much better than Muslims do.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200102010637/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211445754847473671): I'm not talking about terrorists.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191230090245/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211445430862721025): I wasn't equating them with robbers.  I was just looking for bad vs good.  I could of chosen completely different things for both.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191230145111/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211444870755356672): Yes it does mean that.  They are interpreted  completely different than you are suggesting.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200113200223/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211444524087697410): You should.  I'm happy with their record.  But I don't want to attack you either.  We just see things so differently.  But religions change.  Maybe not Islam and that is one of my criticisms, but all of the other religions change all the time.  The interpretation of text changes.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200110062243/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211443473225670656): I don't care what either books say.  I just care about what either of their adherents do.  I appreciate that you want to prevent another holocaust. I'm not trying to attack you but I think the truth about both should be told.  I know you see a different truth.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191231040618/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211442324250800128): Your girlfriend won't admit that bias is behind so much of the criticism of Israel.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200101055224/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211441904291893249): If she were defending a nurse it's ok.  If she were defending an armed robber it's not ok.   Judaism as practiced is not anything like Islam as practiced.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200108201258/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211441325935136768): That's the biggest softball question ever. The Zio horrors are equivalent to the best Islam has to offer. You are comparing 1% Jaywalking to 35% abusing their children and 85% abusing their wives and daughters and 95% abusing their animals.  That's just the first chapter.
* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200103193024/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211440183691886592): Oh look!! https://twitter.com/AdamMilstein/status/1211435966658961408?s=20

* [30 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200109091319/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211438203728740358): You'd have to really look for them like you did.  What she is saying is that what she experienced was not from avid, manic research, but just their everyday life.  And it was horrid.  And why don't you critics of 'how horrible Israel is' care about Islam's way worse horrors?
* [29 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191230101235/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211432724147425280): How does NYC elect a total mental case as their mayor? https://twitter.com/atensnut/status/1211321609648295936

The children can rule out careers as piano players though...I'm not sure whether those parents have taken that into account.  I hated to cut my dogs toenails and these Demons are cutting their kid's fingertips
* [29 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200109080634/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211428135918587904): I sense it will be.  It feels like it will happen🙂.

* [29 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200114164356/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211424771088486409): I'm hungry but I can't eat now.  Maybe in 45-60 minutes.  I do have to eat, eventually.

* [29 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200104065923/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211418142322438147): You're taking that all out of context but your will be taking over obviously
* [29 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200110170045/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211415526897078274): How can you say that that's a lie?
* [29 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200114110237/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211415039997042688): That's fantastic news!

He was a computer programmer for Microsoft in Seattle. He wasn't especially good or bad from what little I knew of him.   Thank you so much for what you have said about Jews.😊 I agree for the most part.
* [29 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200102011542/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211412449418760192): I would certainly say so!

* [29 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200107192809/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211410446533775360): I don't think the Jews are anything like that. Not here not in Israel not in Europe. I don't think you'll find Jews like that if you go back all through history. But you can find them all over Pakistan  it looks like.
* [29 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20200104110218/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1211407820727427073): Yes Juanita Broderick. I don't think she's a very big fan of Bill or Hillary. I was really surprised to find out that he was a rapist. I didn't really see that in him. Even so I don't see him as evil as she is. I think he just happened to marry the most evil person in the USA...

When she was first lady I thought you was quite attractive. I didn't know at the time did she was a Master Criminal. I think she may be the most accomplished criminal in United States history.

The fact that he's using it for dual purpose, so I don't know.  You would think that the Second Amendment and the castle doctrine would override the other considerations.

There are large hammers and very large screwdrivers and axes of every size.  There are 4 ft long metal pipes and baseball bats.

The problem of mass shootings has been that they've almost all been done in gun-free zones.

The universities are the biggest danger to our future.  Our immediate future, and obviously long term.  The reason the Democrats are the way they are now is that our universities are bearing leftist fruit

But that doesn't stop the Pals from neglecting them in every conceivable way.  The animals in Gaza are at the bottom of the list for its residents who have a caste system with the most vicious at the top, and the most helpless and vulnerable at the bottom.

The Muslims have taken (mostly by force) 1200 times the land that Israel has now (which is way larger than they originally agreed to when the Arab greed and savagery roared up like a rabid lion).  The Jews just fought for their lives and still must.

None of that should ever be necessary.  It is an affront to the humanness of the Jews.  It is an obscenity that they are forced to fight for their lives.   And they have nowhere else to go.

I'd bet it was an error because they do the same thing every month, and it is irregular for a discovery like that with so many is included.

I saw the 1200 number, then the 600 number and I thought that they didn't count the discovery in Fallujah.    It turns out that the 6oo number was of injured, and you are right, they did include it in there total. I can only assume that they just add them up

I just went to "the religion of peace" website and in the last 30 days it lists 100 attacks in the last 30 days.  That's 100 with a 1 and two 0s!  And it counts them all but while it has the discovery from 2016, with its 643 victims, IT DOESN'T ADD THEM TO THE TOTAL.

For example, I have been saying that Alan Dershowitz's book "The case for Israel" presents such devastating arguments for Israel's being in the right, that if only 10% were true, the case for Israel would still be open and shut...overwhelming.

If the rest is accurate than we have a tremendous amount of Islamic violence. Even if only 1/2 were true. This isn't about the website.  That's' a distraction.

They only keep the Jews safe for propaganda points in my opinion.  They threaten to kill every Jew in Israel and they pay others to do just that.

Their behavior is so much better than anyone else would be under their circumstances.  They could have pushed the Pals out or killed many of them.

I'm talking about the Indonesians by the Dutch.  As far as literal Dhiminis, like the Jews were in all Arab lands, that's exactly what was done to them.   Exactly.
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226175614/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1210254360212623362): I would term it a holocaust of the Indonesians because they refused to be dhimmis of the Dutch any longer. The Jews never ever and could never ever bring themselves to do such a thing, and certainly not unless it was self-defense.

Is the red cross, or the army, after a cataclysmic event, like a hurricane.  Maybe colonizers can do more good than bad.  It all depends.  Jews have it in there DNA to be helpful.  But then they ran up against Mohamed...

But likewise don't attack people for their success.  If they don't hire Arabs, it would only be based on Arab bad behavior, because their natural inclination is to be helpful.  Unlike the Arabs towards them.  Very unlike that.

They will threaten the whole world as the 4th reich.  Nothing is more important than preventing all of that.

I never heard of a holocaust perpetrated upon a people because they refused to subject anymore.  I don't really know of any quite like this.  This was a holocaust because they demanded their freedom!!

That would be in reaction to a unified attack against them.  Your point was that that was the plan all along and it was an ongoing effort.

The Jews are the ones in this country that started all of the civil rights efforts for others to join the workforce from blacks to the handicapped to women.  They are far more open and generous than the Arabs on their very worst day.

I do know that's what they (Trump) had in mind and I support his genius in that 100%.  False accusations my ass.  What is with you??  Who fills the vacuum cant be worse, so be hopeful.  I'm sure Trump and Pompeo will do what they can.

Part of their mandate was getting along with the Arabs.  There is much evidence of their attempts to do so.  The reasons for that are obvious.  So I don't believe they wanted to shut them out unless it was reactive and became a means of self-defense.
* [26 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191226165336/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1210238881800568835): Their true colors are visible for those who are willing to see.  They don't really care at all about the things that they say they do.  But they have almost a monopoly on the means of communication in the west.

Those organizations represent the world.  And the world sucks. The human race is extremely flawed.  Two of its lights, Israel and the US, are it's biggest targets.

Rape among whites in the west is much, much lower in the West, and sex with animals is not legal, or practiced, in most of the west.  You are way wrong.

Britain was there to witness it all.  And they decided that the Jews needed their own property to keep themselves safe and unmolested.

A hundred Deir Yassin's, even from the worst possible angle, can not match a holocaust of 300,000 people who merely wanted independence in their far off land.

There were literally 10s of millions of refugees around the time of that war and since, and they were not Arabs so they were resettled quickly.

Even Benny Morris, the famous anti-Israeli Israeli historian, has stated that maybe 5% but less than 10% were ordered to leave by Israelis.

They had a hard leftist government while the Islamists were wreaking havoc, especially against Sweedens women, they were lying about it, insisting that the crime increase had nothing to do with Muslims.

To buy another Cadillac?  And there was an effort to work against Jewish refugee immigration to other countries why?

They didn't punish the Pals for what they suffered from Europeans.

In Israel's case the "ocupation" is an act of defense. How the Palestinians are treated is determined by them.  It is not Israelis who determine it.  They are just reacting as made necessary.

The fault would go to those that caused the martial law to be necessary.  And my math was wrong,  it was closer to 18 yrs.  After they lifted it, the violence against the Israelis escalated.

All the UN did was grant it to the Jews, with the provision that the Arabs that lived there would be given full citizenship.  The title went from Syria to Britain, to the Jews.  Just a title change, really.

I think the ones inside were always citizens.  They will remain under martial law for a thousand years if they keep making war on Israel for that long.  It has always been their choice to be the enemy.

That is never the case in history.  They left during the fighting and no one in their right mind would let them come back in. They weren't allowed back in because they were an existential threat.  Israel dealt with enough threats already!

I course they would have been full citizens.  That was agreed to before the UN vote.

And the way it transpired was the way it transpired.  Arab agression was what happened.    Do not those memes help you understand that.  Do they not.     If you say no, then you have your eyes closed tight like other leftists do. Closed tightly.

Second, they accepted the partition with the Muslim minority.  Who knows if it would have been a Jewish State at that point?  It may have been just a Jewish majority state.

The people whose side your on are at fault and you can see that by these memes.  If they were reasonable and decent it never would have transpired the way it it.  They should have all gotten along as friends.

There are far too many that are.  As far as a second Holocaust, there is no way to tell if it will be racial in the way it was with the Nazis.  For instance, in the Spanish Inquisition, they accepted converts.

Number 2 even within that law, it is legal to keep the land if it is necessary for ones defense against its previous owner. So doe that end this argument of your finally?

So, in other words, 9 separate Arab countries, EXPELLED their Jewish countryman, who had LIVED THERE CONTINUOUSLY FOR 1000s and 1000s or YEARS.  But why...? It couldn't possibly be because OTHER JEWS, IN ANOTHER COUNTRY, WON A WAR AGAINST OTHER ARABS?
* [23 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191223132458/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1209097606451871745): The reason they expanded after 67 is that they were attacked, once again.  They won the land in a defensive war, so they deserve it.  They also need it for defense, as the Arabs have made it so clear.
* [23 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191223183100/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1209096818115698688): Wait.  Wait.  You are talking about the 850,000 expelled from 9 Arab countries?  You are saying they were expelled due to the Arab/Israeli war?

That left a very sizable minority of Arabs in Israel's new state.  But the Arabs wanted no part of living under Jewish sovereignty.  It was pure racism.
* [23 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191223194311/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1209093597095698433): The vote for the partion plan was Nov 29th.  The Pals and many factions of the Neighboring countries started murdering Isaraelis on Nov 30th.  On May 15th, the UN voted for Statehood of Israel.

That's what happens with immigrants.  And there were many Jews who already lived there.  As far as the 850, 000 Jews who were expelled from Arab lands, there is no dispute about there deserving Israels land.
* [23 December 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20191223191458/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1209088524265443330): There was a dispute between two peoples in that land. It was adjudicated in favor of Israel. Everything after to push the people of Israel out was illegal in the immoral.

You don't get to keep attacking them and then saying they can't keep what they got from from that attack. You can't just say it never happened when it did happen.

I'm going to have to look into that. Didn't they say that they would transfer some land from present Israel so they could keep the small percentage of the West Bank where they've already built up?

Otherwise this would have been solved 50 years ago. After their living in peace for a while they can establish a state.

It was supremacist and immoral  Israel is behaving in a defensive and necessary way to protect themselves against 1 1/2 billion people who act in a way that is similar to the Nazis.  But you refuse to open your head and heart.

That's what you do not see. Israel is not the cause of those circumstances.  Israel has been the victim of those people no matter what it has done or not done.  The only things that ever worked are exactly what Israel is doing now.

It's quite something that it perplexes you, or that you find it unfair and immoral.  I think that you simply refuse to consider all of the facts so you fail to come up with the correct assessment.

The percentage of Israel's military budget that they get from the US is only about 5%.  Israel loses money on the deal because it is stipulated that they cant sell their great stuff to Russia or China.

If you add up all the Arab or all the Muslim Countries it's way more. The same is true for what the US spends to help countries.  Israel is nowhere near the top, and again if you add up all the Muslim countries... Soldiers are expenseive...none in Israel.

Very few have been fired.  I think the exit polling might be more important than ever, as it tends to be accurate and if it differs too much and he loses...

The Dems have been acting so crazy though, from the time they began spying on his campaign to the endless attempts to disqualify him.

My question is which riots will be worse:  When he wins, or when he replaces RBG on the Supreme Court with that young Catholic woman who is staunchly pro-life??

Those obsequious congresspeople voted to impeach him and their voters will not look kindly on that.  Remember, those congresspeople ran as conservative Democrats.  They caved to the pressure from the party though. Nancy may lose both the impeachment and the house.

Either to pump them selves up...Thats a necessity to survive.   Or to brag and congratualate themselves after the fact.  You are plum crazy to think they werent scared to death.

They may wish to do something, and then reality will hit them in the face later when it is time to act.  It makes no sense to blame only Israel when the Palestinians are actually to blame.

Just stop attacking for a while, declare the wish for peace, and then Israel will see the change and start treating them better.  In a few years, they'll have a state and Israels friendship and help.

The handcuffs are not the rape.  They are the restraining of the rapist. Minus the rape, the handcuffs would be a crime.

They would love to remove it and spend their time curing cancer and authoring novels.  They must stop attacking first, and then the blockade will be removed. That's the simple logic.  It cant be the reverse.

Those are Arabs attacking Jews and Jews don't act like that to an innocent person in a car.  That's a clear difference right there, my sweet.

The flag is not even touching the man that you say whose pocket it is sticking out outrageously from.  You can see the space between the man and the flag.  It doesn't touch that man.  The two Israeli agents in the other photo are making an arrest.

Most importantly, they are acting like savages, so it is obviously not Israelis, but their enemies. Have some coffee.  You need it badly.  I'm half asleep but this is too easy.

They all required a heap of assumptions to find fault with the Israelis.    I've been actually surprised at the absence of images or videos that show anything.  They more often put Israel in a good light, than not.

In the worst possible scenario it shows the criminal murder by one Israeli.  Nothing more.

I've considered it and I've come to the conclusion that the Pals have been almost as bad and as culpable as imagination allows, and that Israelis have been nothing short of saintly.

The police won't go through a door when they hear someone being attacked, for minutes on end?  They could have called the fire dept and went in through the balcony?

That shows you the power of the left-wing press.  Our police are the most professional in the world.  At least the most professional they have ever been.  You are absorbing so many lies.  This proves to me how wrong you are about Israel. Oops.

Who am I to judge?  Obviously not you.  Imagine what a disaster that would be, based on what you are saying right now!

The deal was a loser, even if they had upheld it.  Both Trump and Churchill...I mean Netanyahu, said that even if upheld, the deal was for Iran to get the bomb.

It is not necessary for the robbery, but it is a separate crime in itself, like rape. https://twitter.com/Bamafanaticfan1/status/1207238065548414976

They deserve each other if you ask me. As far as antisemitism is concerned, they are both part of the problem.

Blacks attacking whites is very common.  That's why it should be reported, and discussed, instead of the media going crazy when the reverse happens.

Than you said the answer was that Israel was the Permanent occupier.  So that was a different answer than those two books, which were both about history before Israel.  So, enough of that.

I was just about to protest that you have not at all answered that until I saw the last line. But that is an admission that you were not being truthful.  The clear implication, by referencing those two books, was that Jews have always been at fault for their problems.

Iran harrases inocent states that are not bothering it. Israel isn't doing that in the least.  Without exception, every single conflict Israel has is the result of aggression against it

Israel is much more of a democracy than Iran is, so it is not so easy to describe the Iranian people by looking at their insane government.

If something about the shirt is to thought of as representing the sentiment of the Israelis, it is the fact that it was so controversial and that they discontinued it immediately.

Thats the take away from the story of this shirt.  But your not interested in the truth.   Your using this shirt  Is illustrative of two things. 1.  Your dishonesty and bias. 2.

I have a predilection that many of these guys are Jewish.  Especially when they know a lot about Israel and Jewish history.  It seemed to be my question of his possible Jewishness that sent him back into 'private mode'.  It is the second time that happened

If I were in charge, based on what they did, along with the neighbors, I would have expelled them.  But I wasn't in charge, and they were not expelled.

But the lack of Jews in the Arab states, who have 120 times the land of Israel, is Israel's fault.  That's a good one Rola.  You go with that.

Our actual expenditure to Israel is less than 1/1,250  of the federal budget and nowhere even close to what she claims.

It was the Arabs who tried to take by force the Jewish homes, like they did in most other Arab countries and like they did in Europe.  The Arabs lost their homes because they started a vicious war.

After all, to achieve their leftist goals, they have diverged from their original mandate to report the news, and now lie about and manipulate the news.

If the Zionists stop attacking, the Pals will increase their attacks on them.  This is self-evident.

We have the same reaction in the US, although not quite as bad.  I simply don't understand it.  They claim that they are worried about a nonexistent backlash.

I said he exposed the horror of them, (to the public).  Of course, I condemn all rape.  It is you who tries to minimize or lessen the culpability, of Muslim rapists.

For example, if 3 blacks go into a Jewish grocery and kill 3 people that's a small Massacre. If the three blacks are shot by cops in a gunfight and killed that's not a massacre.

Of course I condemn them under Hamas. They are not doing anything that's necessary. They are being aggressive. Israel is an established state and they won't stop bombing it and attacking it

But behavior in war is not the same as Behavior under normal conditions. And Israel is in a unique situation. So what you would call a human's rights violation in China where they are not threatened would be different than in Israel

Why aren't they dressed as Jews, and arresting them when they attack. And then given stiff sentences for hate crimes. I have not heard of one arrest.

I am talking about the Iranian government.  The Saudi government did not carry out the 9/11 attacks.  It was largely carried out by Saudi terrorists, and financed by some rich  Saudi princes.

Perhaps we should stand back and let Iran attack and overtake the Saudis. That should be advantageous...to them but not for anyone else.

You are misinformed about what Israel does and doesn't do. You are misinformed about what other countries do and don't do.
