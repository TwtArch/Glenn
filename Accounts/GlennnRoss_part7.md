Wouldn't you be ecstatic if the folks you support had such people doing such things?  I think you'd be very pleased.  Have you ever reflected on the fact that your side has no such groups of people?

It is not even an indictment of those men.  It might be, but we would need to know a lot more.  It could  even be a picture of men behaving honorably, and worthy of praise. (Doubtful, but possible)

You, like other leftists, just have a very narrow focus on those two countries, and are always looking for any perceived imperfections you can exploit.

You know as well as I do that until  2 or 3 generations ago Jews only married withing their ethnic clan.  That went on for 3000 years.  Well it definitely was the case for the last 2000 years.

The nuances are minimal, in comparison to the major aspects of this conflict.  It is as close to black and white as any conflict between humans can be.

Look at the way Arabs treat each other, their friends, relatives, minorities, and enimies. Look at how they treat their women, children, and animals.   Look at their philosophy of life, and compare in each instance to Jews.

The Jewish state is so small and the Islamic lands are so large because the Islamic lands were largely taken by force.  We see it today all over the world.

She has a Jewish mother, so it is a genetic thing.  She is not religious.  I don't think she was raised as a Jew but in a secular home.  I think she was raised as a secular liberal.   She told me she has no real connection to Jewishness.

Islam has declared war on progress.  They did this centuries ago, and in large parts of the world, they have won.

It is "resistance" to accepting that Israel is a good and decent state that is working hard to contribute to the human endeavor and is doing a bang-up good job of it.

He has challenged one and all to debate him on Israel. Most won't dare.  As I said, you cour randomly throw out 90 Percent of his case and the remaining 10 percent is more than enough to make the case conclusively  The UN is an international disgrace

His body of work is so utterly devastating to your false narrative that you would have to try to discredit him on other issues and for other reasons. He smashes your lies to pieces.

Whether finkelstein's mother was or wasn't or whether Dershowitz lied about that doesn't change the overwhelming case that he made

I think leftism, or Cultural Marxism, is changing everything.  Most specifically, it is allowing for third world Immigration, specifically Muslim immigration, that will change everything. I hoped Trump would turn that

I always took issue with those who liked Spock better.  They were trying to prove their intelligence.  Same people who liked John Lennon more than Paul McCartney.

I loved everything about that movie.  I loved the woman in her short skirt.  I loved the IQ booster and the giant invisible monster that came from our inner thoughts!

At least in theory.  If I had to mete it out I think I would waiver.  Better to let someone else do it and close the door and walk away.  I just think too many get away with too much.  I think so much is so outrageous.

More than I suspected.  A lot more and it is a little scary.   I'm shocked at the worldwide movement and all the bs literature that they have created for each other to read and to coalesce around.

Actually, I don't get any of them really.  I think there is something supernatural about it.  Like the devil is behind it.  Otherwise, it hardly makes sense.  It hardly makes sense from any light.

You have no idea what I'd like to do to animal abusers.  Actually, pretty much the same as they do to their victims.   And nothing could be more vicious than that.

I can use that as a common springboard to try and work the Pal/Israel thing out.  If they are for animal rights they should be on Israel's side.

They ache for peace.  It should be obvious to her.  It is to me. 2nd.  They only would need more land for defensive purposes if the Arabs keep bringing war on them.

There is an ongoing campaign of violence against Israel that hasn't let up for 71 years. And the victim count of Israelis is not the measure.

I've challenged him a couple of times when he got really low and in the gutter talking to Joseeji, but that was a while ago.

There is no benefit to acknowledging the reality of an imperialist ideology from the dark ages that has managed to fell country after country and convert them to chanting cave dwellers like themselves.

How can you possibly grow up Jewish, (observant or not) and convince yourself that antisemitism is mostly about Zionism? There are some powerful psychological forces at work here pushing you to attribute antisemitism mostly to Zionism.

The Jews on the other hand have been evicted how many times in history.  And your not going to stand with them now.  When they allowed the Arabs to stay and they were being evicted and murdered everywhere?

It's exterminationist.  It is Mystical. No other hatred is like it. It is why your grandchildren will end up in Israel. That's the last place they can be accepted. You know this.

That is the biggest clue 2 what's going on. You're desperately trying to find a reason, and you are creating the reason in Zionism. How else could you explain denying all the antisemitism in history?

But that's where equality ends.  The mistake that is often made is that the equality we all share in inalienable human rights is claimed to extend to other areas where it does not belong.

Even non-Jews take up the practice for the medical benefits.  It's nothing like the procedure the Muslim girls go through.

If that is to lead to a judgment of Christians over Muslims, then so be it.  If it is to lead to a judgment of Muslims over Jews, then so be it. Muslims over Christians, and over Jews, so be it.

You are judging based on who's Jewish and who is not.  That is why your judgments are imbalanced.  We are judging on behavior.  It is you who are refusing to do that.

The warnings from Israel began before these attacks began.  For weeks at least.  I remember them.  Since then, 10,000 times.  They know what they are participating in, and they know what will be done to stop them.

This needs to be stated?  We really haven't advanced at all... if people need to stand behind a sign, proclaiming the right to defend themselves against violence!

Hot weather for those that like that (most).  That is the end of my list.    It seems that most of the worst people are drawn there.  I've encountered more A. holes in a week in South Fl. than a decade anywhere else!

That's because when you're fighting with someone who has a gun on their hip that gun is accessible to either party. Settler violence is punished if applicable.

So they at least should State unequivocally that they do love Western value s

You're swimming in a left leaning pool so everything that goes down the middle seems biased to you.  How about the NY Times or the WAshington Post.
