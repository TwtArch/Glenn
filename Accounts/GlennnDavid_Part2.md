We have to find a way to institute fair and honest reporting.    Two elements that come to mind are bipartisan control and artificial intelligence.

They had more than equal rights to it & were willing to share it,   THE ARABS TRIED TO FORCIBLY TAKE IT AWAY FROM THEM, AND SLAUGHTER THEM IN THE PROCESS!   Isreal clearly wins on moral grounds!

How could the Jewish ones vote this way?  They were having the crap bombed out of them.  I mean you were. Is this vote against the Iron Dome something different than has ever happened before?

I've done some of that myself.  When you tell me that they wouldn't help the animal because you were white and they even were threatening to you is just so, so disgraceful.  That word hardly is enough to describe it.

After I started getting a lot of notifications it started getting very difficult to miss replies.  I have to remember to bookmark conversations to get back to them.    Reading about your rescuing animals in bad neighborhoods very striking.

This is one more of countless attacks on completely innocent Jews by Blacks!  Or maybe they just attacked because he was White!  My whole life never saw a Jew attack a completely innocent black!

I will say that the states that are all around poor Israel are all bad ethnostates.  Some of the worst that exist.  I haven't read anything from you but I assume from your question that you are totally disgusted with them.

And it was made even harder by quote tweeting me instead of replying directly as I am here.  This way a chain is constructed so the discussion can be followed.  You called my earlier tweet hate speech. How?

Are you claiming that my tweet is hate speech?  I disagree and am happy to defend it.    That is if you don't run away and block me.

These leftist freaks are ushering in an age of racial oppression and racial division.  They are trying to turn this country into a Bosnia, except it could even be much much worse.

I hope they are copied by someone in case it's policy to destroy them because it's a great big expose of reality.  Maybe they keep them a long time though in case they need to prove something later on.

I think what they are catching is what has been true since the 1970s, and it's 180 degrees opposite of their narrative.

The media does everything in their power to turn people against the police, particularly blacks.  They used Trump as a prop to do that.  He didn't do a single thing, and yet they pounded away with BS.

I think the attacks on Asians give us a clue. It's a combination of resenting our success and not fearing us.  We don't bite back.

Perhaps the most important is the thinking that Jews have no teeth.  They won't gang up, or set your house on fire, stab you in the neck, or threaten to rape your wife.  Our enemies are both jealous, AND unafraid.

Charge, attack, accuse etc. We have nothing to be defensive about!  They do, and we have to make that very clear.  We've been on the defensive and we look guilty because of it.

But  Tucker Carlson is a talk show competing against others for ratings.    Our arena is completely different. And think of the monster we had to let loose to fight the Nazis.

I think cell phone cameras, security cameras, the internet (where these pictures and videos can be posted and distributed), and alternative news, (Fox, Newsmax, Daily Wire, etc) are what have changed.

They thought he was a whack job, and from that time until now, comparing themselves unfavorably to the Jews underlies their visceral hatred. Israel being right there, amongst them, makes them look and feel like primitives.

Where did you pull that one from?  When a cop is presented with a situation, he has to make hundreds of generalizations right away.  And some of them have to do with the potential threat they may be facing from the people involved.

But we can't have our right to peacefully protest taken away by threat of violence from a small violent minority representing the other side.  In fact, I think there should be many protests, and they should be ongoing.

Why do they see racism where it is not, and at the same time not see it where it clearly is?  They seem to be mentally living in the 1940's...or what their idea of the 1940's was like.   They're living in the past, while ignoring the present.

But I certainly don't miss him, and neither do his victims of the past or of the future.   He was abused, and he died because he was pretty much dying at the time that his abuse happened.

You guys don't need that though.  Like the Islamists, the Communists, and the Nazis, you just create history.  You don't document it.  You create it.

He threatened to throw someone down the escalator, cursing and talking in the most low-life way you could ever imagine. He and his vampire governor brother have both disgraced their father.

Anywhere but the red state of Texas! For well over 72 hours, until the 19th, he had been nowhere to be seen.  Not a word!  Not a gesture!  But wait, they can pretend to blame Ted Cruz!

The left, or the right?  I challenge and respond to many tweets from the left.  Maybe 1 out of a dozen will even reply back.

This guy that Nancy is sicking on MAGA seems very much like a Grand Wizard of the KKK.  Just with new targets.    I do not like what I have been seeing.

To me, it kind of brings to mind the Tanya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan story.  I see Kamala as a Tanya Harding type. Only more dangerous in every single way. pic.twitter.com/C2GVOf0J6R

Now the reverse has occurred. The Dems have essentially coppied the Nazi's fake attack on their own Congress. ‚ö†Ô∏èüò°

That is not the reason people are rallying behind her though.  They are rallying because they see a fighter who is going to give it right back to these criminals, and do so with class.
