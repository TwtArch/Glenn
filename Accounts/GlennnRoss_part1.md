What better way to honor him.  I believe he has earned it, and what better way to stick it to the criminal Dems?

They joke, they laugh, they nod in agreement. Good times. This is groupthink. The unthinking agreement of the mob. https://www.blabber.buzz/blab/pop/1023564-opinion-the-assault-on-the-right-is-the-result-of-our-broken-unchecked-university-system?utm_source=activities&utm_medium=activities-logged-in-scroll&utm_term=activities-logged-in-scroll-web

I think I could arrive at the truth of things better by seeing points argued about...point, counterpoint, back and forth.  Hannity vs Cuomo.  Tucker vs Lemon.  That kind of thing.

When fascists seize power, they often attempt to isolate or punish their enemies, and detractors. Historically, they've had little way of knowing who most of their detractors were.

They were 10 million times more in the right than the racist rioters we had for 6 months, and their actions were not sanctioned by Trump or any Republicans.  So the whole argument that the left is making is pointless and nonsensical.

You run them straight into the ground like you're doing with the rest of the New York City!  You're an utter disgrace and that's how you'll be remembered.

I cant say "I hate fags, or you smell like a fag" because they meant cigarettes somewhere or sometime else.

Absolutely.   But I don't think that means that in each case, in every point made, arguing against the decisions and policies of Zionist leaders is an attack on the Jewish race.

I do have a huge problem with the argument that there was an alliance between the torturers and the tortured.  When anyone makes any kind of argument like that, it is a big red flag.

In neither case is that true at all.  Who the hell knows what Israel's actions are?  The international media does nothing but lie 24/7 about Israel, and they lie 24/7 about Israel's enemies.

I blame lies, distortions, and envy.  Israel is hated because of antisemitism.  Antisemitism is not because of Israel.  Israel was created largely as a response to antisemitism.  You couldn't be more wrong about this.

We are all animals, but that is beside the point.  Training dogs, for example, is difficult.  But you can't blame the dogs.  It is the trainer's techniques and skills that make it successful or not.    Same goes for a trial lawyer.

( I would do anything for him.  He is one of my biggest heroes).  That's a distraction people try to use to not deal with someone's arguments.  His arguments are rock solid.

We are the jury.  We are who she is making the arguments to.  And she needs to convince us of her goodwill, and gain our trust.  She's done that with me.  But few others.

That is going off on a tangent.  Your aim is to convince us of your arguments, and you aren't being successful.  I don't think anyone could be, because the arguments favor Israels' positions.

You haven't convinced us that you are right about this, and I believe it's because you are not right about it.    You won't even read Alan Dershowitz great arguments.
* [11 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201211070058/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1337291208318705666): What did I say?  I'm not following.

I don't think Israel is happy about it one bit.  I think it's Israel's enemies that are to blame here.  I really, really, really do.

You have to do what works with them. So it's on you.  They are who you are trying to convince, and it is working with some (me ), but not for most.  So you have to change something if you want it to work with them

I have no qualms with them fighting back, and I hope you feel the same way.  They don't believe you seek a just solution.  And they think you are A.S.  You've convinced me, but not them.   It's on you to persuade them.

It doesn't seem like that was the case at all.

And the narrative that blacks are victims.  The left is regressive.  They absolutely live in the past.  I find it shocking that their minds eye takes precedence over their real eyes.

I don't know if they do but I think they should. You never want your enemies to be well-financed.  You don't want them to use any more money for weapons, military infrastructure , training, etc. In other words, that is there own damn fault.

I have serious questions about whether I am or not, and Compa is right that I don't know enough, but I think I'm just trying to call balls and strikes as I see them.

I hate that argument and have argued with her and others against it.  It is a hateful stupid argument and I've made it many times.   Still, Zionist leadership does not equal Jews in general.

People who hate Trump accuse him of everything under the sun, instead of confining their accusations to certain points that are real.  I'm arguing against conflating things and overgeneralizing.  I attack her anti-Israel arguments.

Say she meant "Jewish leadership in Israel"?  The main thing that she meant was leadership in Israel. It is simply backward reasoning to think that Jewish leadership means Jews in general.

Yes, I guess all Zionist leaders are Jewish but she said Zionist leaders.  She did not say Jews.  Or even Zionists.  She said Zionist leaders.  Zionist leaders do not equal most or all Zionists, or Jews. WTH??

I dont think so at all, and I simply am confused by Josee.  I always have been.   And if she didn't like Jews that is not a crime.  It would be if she harmed them though.  Expressing opinions on Twitter is not a crime.

In fact those that are deserved are not thought of as negatively as they deserve to be thought of. But that's not what I meant. I meant you were wrong when you said that Palestinians did nothing to deserve what happened.

I am not totally out of the loop here, and I would guess that no more than 15% of Americans would write that down as an answer to the question " "What is another term for British people?"

Now, in the U.S., they are simply arresting people and then letting them out.  They are using racial disparity to justify it.  Guess what America?  That does not justify it at all.

They have been  doing so ever since Arafat stopped brushing his teeth. Palestinians made terrorism famous and everyone knows that. From hijacking airplanes and cruise ships to the International Olympic games.

And if you use logic , any army that can be called the most moral army in the world,  by anyone, has to be comparatively moral.  For example, no one is going to call any of Israel's enemies armys the most moral army in the world.   Isn't that right?

I never experienced antisemitism.  I've never been to Israel either. I'm confused about how someone that hates Jews would like talking with them all day?  I don't think I was virtue signaling though. I'll be more circumspect though.

I never participated and discouraged that, but the will of the people prevailed.   But no, people did not retweet tweets to get more people to report them.

There were no rules in the Chat room.  I wanted a free and open chat room.  I even wanted Josee and people like her in it, but the rest of the group was dead set against it.

I find you obnoxious because you are obnoxious, though.  You came into my group and were obnoxious to me immediately like you had a chip on your shoulder.

If I said it wasn't I was wrong, but it was a one-off and not representative of anything really.  The black antisemitic attacks were happening dailly.

I imagine it is way inflated like it is in the US, but I think it is a bigger problem there.  As is Muslim antisemitism.  I think that is the biggest AS problem in Europe.  Blacks that are violent against Jews are racist.

But it's way riskier to not just bomb them.

Israeli morals and laws force it to take dangerous risks all the time.  The same goes for the US Police forces.  That's why there is such a high casualty rate among both groups.

Israel are the sheep here, but they are very smart sheep and they have developed a very robust security apparatus. When children get harmed, or anyone else, the blame has to go to the wolves. It's they that insist on this fight.

How can you ask such a question to the people who put more emphasis on protecting their racist enemies than anyone ever has in all of history? Why can't you see who is who in this?

This loved one has a knife of her own, and with lightning speed, she attacks him, and she goes home to care for her children and to live her life that was almost ripped from her in a violent horrible attack.

The entire idea seems utterly batty.  And as unrealistic as anything could be!  The U.N. security council is only second to Iran in wanting Israel destroyed!

It's better to see Israel's situation precisely as it is, because it doesn't translate well to other countries' experiences or circumstances.

You are all being manipulated to do so as a way of separating political factions and getting you lefties to join and fight for their political team. They are literally drugging you lefties with this racism nonsense.

If I'm right about that, then please take a closer look at the U.N.  Especially in regards to the U.N. and Israel.   I  find the U.N. to be a despicable disappointment.

Every animal in the world knows this. If the attack is driven and forced by one, but the other strikes first, it was obviously the one that forced the fight that was the attacker.  Hitting first was a forced choice.  First, or SECOND.

I don't want to get involved in a back and forth.  I just do want to say, though, that a whole lot of the complaints that I read about had nothing or little to do with Israel.

I think I find it more pleasant to speak about things that I don't know in a natural way, and find out through conversation than to check it out first on the internet.  Of course, it is completely situational.

I would like them in the bar if some violent criminal with an unlicensed gun came in the bar though.  But most criminals wouldn't even attempt it. I'd be happy to know that the bar owner had one!

I favor concealed carry, but the distinction between the two...I don't know how big of a deal that is.  Haven't thought enough about it.  Open carry laws are not uncommon, but carrying out in the open is very uncommon, even in those states that allow it.

People who have acquired their guns legally?  I'll tell you this.  I like having these people around.  I want as many as possible.

I have always thought that if someone doesn't want their baby, then that human would prob be better off not coming into the world.  And that is where I stand on this issue now. But I really do see both sides.

I'm not arguing against it either.  I'll have to submit this one also.  I can give you a couple of arguments though 1 Multiple attackers.

Well, let's say it is not nearly a good enough argument to make it determinative.  1st thing we need to know is how representative that is.  Not very, I would guess.  And still, what about the other side?

You are not really cognizant of all the crime that happens here, and all of the victims who didn't have guns.  You are relying too much on the media, who I have learned, more and more, are completely dishonest.

To frame it only as a question of the mother's right to her own body is wrong in my opinion.  She is demanding the right to her babys body as well.

I don't see how they could be fit and healthy on a vegetarian diet?   As far as having another animal die for them...none would.  This is the argument I've had with myself over becoming a vegan.

It would be the difference between one form of unspeakable horror vs another.  I've seen more than enough to last me 100 lifetimes and that was only over the course of about a week.

What I would suggest is searching google for the brand/farm/producer that you want to buy.  You should be able to find out whether they have a good rep with vegans or not that way.

There have been cases where they investigated and found these types of places horrific.   I just know for a fact that the normal way that most eggs are produced is beyond horrific.  I can't even think about it, I'm getting upset thinking about it.
* [ 4 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201204170629/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1334894624167632903): I don't know.  They had a whole African slave thing going.  It might have been others if not for them.  But once they had that setup, they used that setup.   Race and color was a factor but by no means the only factor.  They wanted and needed slaves.
* [ 4 December 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201204165024/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1334896441333084172): I'm stating a practical consideration, and you are going off on a tangent that is beside the point.  The black Africans offered a market of black slaves.  It's like Amazon.  You go to where the sellers are selling.

I don't know how badly the free-range mothers are, but I do know that the normal ones are living in a hell as bad as the holocaust.

Not because they believed it was their God-given right to subjugate a different race, but because their whole economic structure was built around it and depended on it.

Everyone had been living that way for THOUSANDS OF YEARS.   Many back then did not think it was wrong.  Many defend it, even today, in the black, brown, and yellow world   It was mostly Christianity and Western values that came to see it as evil

I seem to care more about racism than the left does.  In fact, the right seem to care much more about it than the left.  The left is like the jury in the Scottsboro trial. Judging on race, instead of conduct. https://www.history.com/topics/great-depression/scottsboro-boys

Not taught by the schools (maybe they are now...probably are) but by society.  Our go-to position is that we are bad and they are victims.    I could not disagree more w that.

If they are going to resist, than the police should do what they have to to not get injured.  In this case, from what I can see, the cop was barbarous and guilty of brutality though.

He had enough drugs in him to kill two men his size (6'5 inch by the way, and that is a factor whether people like it or not.)  He was STUPID to resist!

Most of them (who are haters against us) know next to nothing about the subject.  They just know that they don't like Jews.  They feel inferior next to them.

All you have to do is look at all the slavery within races to determine that slavery was not about race.  It WAS ABOUT BIGOTRY!!  And power!  And Dominance,  and mostly economics.  Race was not Primary!

I'm simply saying that much of historical slavery, and much of slavery that still exists, is within the same race.

I mean that what is considered today to be racist is bullshit.  These ideas about racism did not exist before the Nazis.  The Nazis, and peoples reaction to it, changed everything.

He kicks ass in debate and everyone is afraid to debate him.  You cannot read his book and come away not supporting the same side that I am. Not if you read it with an open mind.

First all the violence has come from the left.   All of it, and there has been a tremendous amount.  Secondly, only the left care 1 wit whether it's a woman or what their race is. The Nazi left care all about that. The right care not at all!

In fact I'm testing it right now against you guys. I'm testing my racial opinions against you guys because I know that  mine are so different and I want to understand why.

The election was clearly stolen if you can't see it he couldn't see a truck bearing down on you. The left has always endangered Jews. Why do you think it's changing now?

I don't want you to get tired of me saying this but that's what you do and that's how you derive your incorrect conclusions.

That's what I meant when I said what difference would it make.

Almost every single attack on Jews in this country comes from the left, usually blacks.  That Synagogue shooting was a one off.
* [30 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130103939/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1333359841251889154): I don't even know what you are talking about.  The press can make a group of 100 people 1 night in one city look like the marching of Attila the Huns attacking armies, if they dont like them, and they do the reverse to those brownshirt armies who are burning down our cities.

Trust me, the armed violent people in the streets of America are all Trump haters and leftist goons.

The Jews were like a person being accosted in the street who banged on Israel's door for help.  The Arabs there joined in the attack.  My God!
* [30 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130102716/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1333356826839150592): Everyone on the left all the way to the most extreme supported Biden's candidacy.  My God, these brownshirts are out in our streets attacking people and their property!!  So what if a tiny group of wackos supports Trump. It's a trumped up contrived issue by the left.

When the UN singles your tiny ass out to condemn more than Iran, N.Korea, everyone combined.   When you have to spend so much effort and capital on security...
* [30 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130101850/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1333354652298059776): You may have it right. I just didn't know about it.  We are an evenly divided country between Americans and neo-communists who have been brainwashed for 3 generations by our leftist corrupt news media and our communist overtaken universities. Our left is even crazier than Europes
* [30 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130101659/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1333353747297284096): It bothers me that you can continue to have any respect at all for the U.N.    Besides the news media, I think they may be the worst institution in the world.  (In the western world). If you would stop defending them, your credibility would go up a lot.
* [30 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130101116/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1333352707336364035): I didn't know that.  But rest assured, it is not America at all.  It is the left.  The same ones that support Biden.  From liberals who don't know any better all the way to Communist revolutionaries.
* [30 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130100935/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1333352261855088640): Nothing is normal with the way Israel is treated so why should Israel pretend that it is.  It can only take so much disadvantage.
* [30 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130100831/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1333351925195153409): I dont like atavistic behavior, and I'll call it out, but I have no savagery in my ideas.   You see, the left has purposely conflated things for political gain.  As racism has waned, they changed the definition,  and they conflated thoughts with actions. Now everything is racist!

Would it be okay in response to an attack on white people, which it probably was? Would it be okay if it was a response to a charge that white people were the most violent Savage dangerous people in the world?
* [30 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130091358/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1333338411382546436): It doesn't scare me at all that Communists support Joe Biden or any Democratic candidate.  What scares me is how gigantic the American and Western communist movement has become and that Joe Biden supports them LOL
* [30 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130091144/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1333337565622120448): It's not. Why should it be a wake-up call? People have been doing the Nazi salute since the Nazis.  Who says that there is an increase now?  And it would have to be a tenfold increase before I would even open one eye towards it.  Even then it would be nothing.

It also seems bigoted. So I can see,  especially someone on the left, not wanting to so easily say we in that instance
* [30 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130085230/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1333332978177597440): I believe you but are you sure? I mean I think it's common usage to talk that way at times depending on the situation.

The end is coming for Jews in the Dem Party, me thinks.

The Jews have really been the most consistent and most frequent target of genocidal desires.  There really hasn't been much desire to wipe any other group off the face of the earth.

I would not be surprised if Biden proposes a historic reduction in America's support for Israel.  In fact, I would be more surprised if we get through the next 4 years without that happening.

That is all they want.  They want judges not to turn away from the awful reality that Guiliani is presenting to them. His case seems more than convincing enough to me. Even Alan Dershowitz agrees.

In fact, they have contempt for them in many cases.  The left believes in their own form of Taquiya.  Acceptance and approval of lying for 'the cause' are not limited only to Islam.

Just because you turn your back on a tidal wave doesn't mean that it isn't there.  The evidence is all over the internet.  Just look at it!

There are never, ever, ever these types of anomalies, or to this extent, and all at the same time   To me, these anomalies are more proof of fraud than anything else the court would need to rule in Trumps favor. The court needs direct evidence though.

They haven't become impoverished. I like the fact that he is willing to make personnel changes to improve things & agree with most of his changes.

He is the only president I know of that has lost money becoming president.  Most others become filthy rich.  I think the presidency has cost him and his family about 2 billion dollars.

CNN regularly makes claims that are the opposite of what everyone can see, and they do it with a straight face.   The media have become nothing more than professional liars at this point.

I don't ever see him doing that to Israel without an extremely compelling reason.   What causes him to support Israel hasn't changed and I don't see it changing: Morality, Religious belief, interest of the US

Do you have any idea how generous these billionaires are to our communities and our country?   Most of the taxes and jobs come from the top 10 percent.  Why is the left against these creators of wealth, jobs, and revenue for everyone else?

I have always celebrated Christmas more than Hanukah.  There are a lot of secular Jews in the West, and a lot of them are liberal.  Still, there is a contingent of fake Jews on Twitter.

For example, the U.S. does not give U.S. soldiers to Israel.  It doesn't chance them dying or getting injured over there.   It doesn't pay their salaries or their upkeep and support over there.  How much $ is that?

You have to look at it holistically if you really want to make informed judgments about who gets what and why.

As far as McCain goes, Trump, being a genius far beyond my own capacity, saw McCain for what he was, which was a backstabbing Democrat in Republican clothing.  And none of this nonsense has anything to do with his conduct as the President of the USA.

There is no racism without action, or conduct.  We must go back from this insanity of trying to assign thoughts to people and then judge those thoughts. That's how they make Repubs racist, absent any policy or behavior at all.  Only behavior matters.

Because I haven't.  I am trying to fight racism, but the Dems and the left are hell-bent on making this a racist society.  You don't see their clearly racist behavior though because the media normalizes it.

There is an entire system of favoritism surrounding blacks in hiring, firing, government benefits, criminal liability, taxes, medical care etc. Societal convention completely favors them too.

Your last sentence is not correct.  It is pretty clear that your last sentence doesn't hold up to scrutiny. It doesn't even seem to at first glance.

Actually, I do, but what I call racism is not acknowledged as such, even though it is as obvious as a cold wind on your face.  What most call racism I don't acknowledge because it's obviously a lie.

They are the beneficiaries of favoritism in every way.  The issues that they have are the result of their own behavior.  Certainly, not anything at all white people are doing.   You can argue historical reasons. But not present ones.

I'm estimating that number but it could actually be closer to 1000x.  This just happens to be the truth.

There are racial attacks by blacks against whites almost hourly all over our country. I've seen them with my own eyes countless times, read about them in the news, seen them on video, heard about them- they are not counted!

Only crimes by whites against blacks are considered hate crimes.  Even though those actually only comprise LESS THAN 1 PERCENT OF THE CROSS RACE HATE CRIMES!!

Imagine a world where whites attacking blacks was a normal and daily occurrence in every city in the country but the racist government didn't consider them hate crimes?

Of course there are equal protection laws though, to make sure the majority doesn't run roughshod over the minority.  This is a Jewish country after all.

My heart is pounding now.   90+ percent of all race-based hate crimes are from blacks toward other races. I swear on my name that is basically true.  It is also true that there are very few hate crimes from whites against blacks.  Compared to B against W it's a joke.

If Harris and Biden get into the White House, that is the perch from which they will say things like "They are proud" of racists, murderers, and rapists.

Circumstances have intervened though.    If he wins, he will have beaten Iran without a single shot by forcing them to the table by means of economic warfare.  An absolutely awesome achievement. Biden is about to stop all that.

He has done everything to confirm that he is thinking along those lines.  If he lost the election outright, I would imagine that he would pull the trigger.  Now it could cause him to lose.

He has been so masterful that he would bring Iran to the table as soon as they know that he won.  But if that didn't work I think he would bomb the crap out of them (In his second term).  Biden would save them from the precipice the same way Obama did.  Dems = Evil

A person saying what she believed.   Beyond that scenario, I couldn't comment without a lot more information.  It doesn't immediately sound like anything that should garner the response that she's been getting.

But blacks in general are about 4 times as likely to be antisemitic than whites.  And unlike whites, they are much more vocal and demonstrative about it.  Their culture and their leaders are much, much more accepting of it.   https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/adl-survey-finds-anti-semitism-high-in-black-community

(who BTW are often labeled as BLM) because it is more acceptable to incorrectly label it as political violence than what it is. Racist Sadismüò°

I think you should have tried to be friends and good neighbors of the Jews. You would have been SO much better off.  You would have thrived. They are a most generous, giving, and kind-hearted people. I think that is a big reason why they have been targeted so.

I can't watch them anymore.  The verbal violence is so common and so frequent. I've seen it 1,000 times in person and been its victim a few times

The people who are protesting are just drinking the Kool-Aid from the media they haven't experienced anything that they're protesting and the reason for that is that it's all a ghost.

There are so many adherents that don't think of it that way.  I agree with you.  But the actual members are like that.  Thier activities are like that.  Thier conduct.

The entire premise of the group is based on a notorious lie.  180 degrees from the truth.  And then they use that lie to be criminal, racist, terrorist, communist, etc.

And please do not block me, I am being sincere here.  Try to persuade me where I am wrong. (I'm not though)  I am proud of the way America 1, and the white world 2, have treated race in the world. 3.  We have led the world away from racism.

Look at how Native Americans are not being criminals towards everyone else by the way.  Most groups aren't.  The Japanese and Asians have valid complaints.  So do Jews, gays, women, etc.

He doesn't slander minorities any more than he criticizes all kinds of groups, and deservedly. The proud boys are blown up by the leftist media.  I don't think they could fill a small auditorium, and they aren't racists.

I think that what happens is that there is much much less than is called for. What is definitely a real phenomenon is black violence and brutality against police officers.  Honestly, against everyone.

I'm pretty sure that is the case all over the western world now.  And most definitely where they are a minority.

Trump NEVER EVER INCITED VIOLENCE OR RACISM OR ANYTHING ELSE.  The entire LW elite estab used Trump to do so themselves.  Trump is 100% innocent and they are 100% guilty.

Youre attacking the most gentle people who inhabit the earth and blame them for fighting back against them and their daily non stop attacks for the past 26, 645 days or so.

I mean, how much responsibility for everything that has happened can be put onto "The Umbrella Man" anyway.  It's good for a laugh I guess.

Jesse Jackson symbolized all that was wrong with the anti-white racist movement.  Then Al Sharpton was even worse.  Now we have Fahrahchan and BLM.

But just telling me someone was beaten to death by security people tells me absolutely nothing about race and racism.

Well, the division you see on CNN and the like for sure, claiming that they are victims of racist white police, politicians, system white society, etc.  But black on black violence is even 10 worse.  So it's not at all about just about division.

* [27 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201127090704/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1332249229494988800): From watching all of the racist acts on video from all of the cell phone reporters out in Twitter land.  But I already knew it before that.  It was just a confirmation of what I knew.  I just didn't know it was that freaking awful.

Can't you just judge things based on empirical evidence, instead of squeezing reality into an anti-western framework?  And what was wrong with being so anti-communist anyway?
* [27 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201127090014/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1332247757822844928): I completely disagree. The lack of support is driven entirely by politics and such concerns.  (I agree with the concerns)  It is politics triumphing over science.  It is attacking Galileo for his discovery It is attacking Freud for his It is attacking Charles Murray for his work.

Nuclear Power is bad The Green N deal.

For example how in the world do you guys make Donald Trump to be a racist (or a fascist)?  When he says "no president has done as much for blacks as him since Lincoln, he means it" The conventional view is that one's thoughts or non-pc speech make someone a racist.

I want to talk to the other side to find the truth.  But they have a real tendency to do what you are describing.  I think the reason is that their ideology is not based on objective facts at all.  They are actually at war with objective facts.

I might have liked some tweets along the way but I couldn't tell you what they were about.  I'm a very promiscuous liker and retweeter.

She is describing a phenomenon. You can disagree with it, but that doesn't make her bad for seeing it differently.  I think she is more right than wrong. And then she is commenting on how bad this phenomenon is.

Around the time you unblocked me. And thank you for not blocking me.  I don't want to upset you but I do want to dialogue and express myself and get feedback, trying to learn how close or far I am from the truth

* [27 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201127080404/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1332233633613148162): I don't think reporting a scientific idea can ever be considered racist or not racist.    There is an accepted understanding of racism being "thinking your race is superior to another"  That definition is ridiculous to me.  Every race thinks they are superior in some ways.
* [27 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201127080111/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1332232889757478913): Hitler started with potty training.  Words do matter.  Insults matter.  Words are like deeds.  Saying something is a deed.  But thoughts should never matter, without deeds.

And after that, the left started claiming racist thoughts on Republicans, and who could prove otherwise? That's exactly how they claim a President like Trump is a racist.
* [27 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201127075559/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1332231607588163588): Hitler and Ana seem a bit different to me, to say the least. Hitler and Ana and myself and you share a lot of things.  What we don't share with Hitler is what he did.  We don't want to do anything like that at all.  The furthest thing from it. Very, very few Jews want to.
* [27 November 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201127075139/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1332230543455494144): My definition of racism is doing something racist.  It has to be a behavior.  An act.  Racist conduct. It is absurd to say someone is racist otherwise.

I agree that it may not be enough in itself for them to make a finding, but it should definitely be enough for them to look for hard evidence of fraudulent ways these anomalies were achieved.

I, for one, do not feel that strongly about this.  I was actually surprised to learn that they couldn't vote, and if I had to choose, I would say that they should be able to vote.

It could be argued that letting people vote who won't take the time to learn about the issues is undemocratic. Their votes nullify those votes from those who care enough to know enough. That's kind of the reason they don't let children vote.

I'm just saying that it is not helpful to try to force a theoretical reality onto something where it doesn't quite fit.

I mean to say that Israelis would object to Arab Israeli citizens not having equal rights unless the reasons for them not having equal rights were sound.  Jews don't go for discrimination or bigotry, no matter what the narrative is on this thread.

What rights do they not have, and what is the reason that Israel won't grant them?  I imagine the reasons are very sound, and that Israelis would object otherwise.

I believe in it as an ideal, as a starting point for society.  I can see that as a foundational principle, but I believe in making adjustments that are needed.

Calling someone a self-hating Jew is calling him one of a group of Jews that you don't like.  It is insulting a certain group of Jews.

Look, Trump has been the target of so many hostile investigations and they have found nothing of consequence when it comes to being the President. On the other hand, the deep state and their media protect Biden and the Dems. They simply claim things were debunkedü§™

BTW, I think that China did allow this to become a worldwide pandemic, stopping internal flights but allowing international ones and lying about it's spread.  I even think that they might have worked with the Dems

It has nothing to do with what Guiliani has discovered about Hunter.  Guiliani is a very serious lawman with a fabulous career.  He investigated Hunter himself, after being given this information by the players themselves in Ukraine.

The others lie about what they are doing and about what the Republicans are doing.  Those are lies.  Trump doesn't really lie in such egregious, consequential ways.

I understand what he is saying, when he means something and when he doesn't.  The press uses his colloquial imprecision against him in the most noxious way.

I would love to get involved in a similar type of discussion about Trump and U.S. politics, but I haven't really found one. I think they must exist, but where?

But I am much more interested in and familiar with what is going on here.  I have never actually been in Israel.  My main interest in Israel has been in the morality of the players in the conflict, and the lying and propaganda about it from the rest of the world.

He is the president, and we should judge him as the president. The media has made it their primary focus to destroy the man based on personal behavior, not presidential behavior. And then they lie about him

I'm just looking for intelligent people to bounce my thoughts off of.   I think Trump may be acerbic and even obnoxious at times but that is on a personal level.   As a U.S. president, I think he is a giant, and a moral leader of the West.

I used to think that Trump was a big liar also.  I was shocked at how well he did in winning the primary and then I was shocked at the high quality of his choices in filling  government positions.

The same way you are when you say that Trump is done.  The U.S. was already finished. I just had a thought and hoped that Trump could keep the US going for another 4 years. I fully expected the left to overwhelm us, but I thought it would start in 2024

What you call lying is simply a colloquial way of presenting things.  He is a product of NY   Arabs also have a culture of boasting and exaggerating.  Anyone who wants to understand Trump can and does

I don't even remember so much of the lies about Israel that I've heard from the Arabs, the UN, or other players in the world, but I have been a witness to many of the lies told my the American media and the Dem Party.

I know for an absolute fact that both the news media and the Democrat Party lie almost all of the time and about almost everything with regard to Trump.  This is not speculation.  I see them do it in real time, almost all of the time.

These people are being threatened by your vicious radical brownshirts, and yet they still feel the need to tell the truth.

The statistical anomalies are clearly enough.  Their respective attendance at the rallies, by themselves, are even enough

I don't know what the technical legal terms that Guiliani will be arguing on, but that is unimportant.   It is a case of mass election theft, through cheating.

They seem to just make declarations, without ever explaining anything.  "Trump has little to no evidence of fraud in this election". That's it.  No refutation of his claims.  No explanations.

They are watching a defensive action. Unlike from the Pals, our efforts are in  stopping the violence.  It's the exact opposite of what the Pals are trying to accomplish.  Many of them, I mean...obviously.

If the Palestinians want peace Israel will respond with peace immediately. Israelis Do want peace.  They ache for it! The Palestinians respond... well you know how they respond.

Whatever has them so upset? I can give you a concrete answer. But I have a question as well. Why are the Palestinians attacking the Israelis?

There would be many deaths if they didn't give a shit like their enemies.  We spend much more effort than they do keeping ourselves as safe as possible.

That is NOT how to judge things.  It's ridiculous.  If a psycho whacks me with a machete for no reason  and I shoot and kill him does that mean that I'm in the wrong because I inflicted more damage?

Living in fear, being hated by your neighbors, no matter how wrong they are!  Having to build a whole security apparatus to deal with such savagery.  Bomb shelters, alert systems, etc.  Try simply taking a shower under such circumstances.

His opinions are to be taken that way.  He has a small following of people such as yourself who don't judge good or bad behavior but instead judge the actors.  Palestinian, Arab, nonwhite, vs Jews, whites, Christians, etc.

Are  not the Iranians threatening to destroy Israel using their nukes, once they get them? That's a war crime right there, and in my opinion, it would be in Israel's rights to do anything from attacking their facilities to dropping a nuke on Tehran itself. https://twitter.com/Rasputinish/status/1329681859878547457

It is a fire-starting device.  Is it not?  Isn't that what it is designed to be? If not children, who are they targeting?  Their mothers?  Their babysitters?  Their teachers?

The fact is that those  balloons endanger farm animals.  As far as whether the Disney character colorful balloons are targeting children or not?  Is it not self evident?

Isn't that an option?  You make it sound like they are fighting tanks with balloons.  They are not.  They are fighting the Israeli people and Israel occasionally sends in their IDF to tamp down their blood lust.
