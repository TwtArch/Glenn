There are countless injustices being carried out against whites every day, unreported, unpunished, and wholly unjustified. And as our percentage continues to shrink, it will only get worse.  Maybe much worse.

I'm talking about doing whatever it takes to actually fix it, so those tenure boards would have to be either gutted or removed entirely. I'm talking about major fundamental changes, kind of like we had under desegragation.

Their claims to be about the party of science and observation are as upside down as their claims to be the party against racism.  Or the party trying to unify the country. They are an Orwellian party of lies and doublespeak.

About as many times as most politicians seeking the presidency and then attaining it. That's all I can think of, anyway...🤔

Very few people would have pushed this 'prayer' about Obama.  There aren't that many opononents of Obama with your type of low character who would have done something like that...

The fundamentals seem to have held over time.  And with a resurgent Communist China, 1.5 billion strong...this stupid failed concept doesn't seem to be fading into the past.

WE PROTESTING ⁉️  Why don't WE PROTEST, say, the UNIVERSITIES❓  They Really Are the Fundamental Source for Our Terrifying Leftist Transformation.  Here is My Question❓  Can we Actually Not Become a Leftist Failed Nation... If We Don't Radically Change Our Schools?

If local Mayors and Governors don't, won't, or can't protect their own citizen's lives and property from the mob, they must be replaced immediately. They can not have the right to allow that.

I actually think a new constitutional law should be considered, in light of recent negligence by state and local officials, that mandates that they protect their citizen's rights.
* [17 August 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200817061232/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1295241841038811137): The rioters are engaging in illegal acts against property and persons.  The elected officials are charged with protecting their constituents' rights, using agencies of law enforcement. It seems like preventing those agencies from performing that mandate should be actionable.

She is advocating for the idea of widespread voting by mail being available to everyone everywhere.  I didn't really suggest that she meant that it should be the only available option.

They do reduce the concentration and amount of virus you take in.  It looks like that's how they work.  The same reason it's hard to catch it when you are outside.

I have said it from the beginning, when Dr. Fauci and the W.H.O. and the CDC said we shouldn't wear them! When they said turn your head, or cough into your elbow, then you knew that masks would help.

They only care about it when those on their "side" were victims of it or could claim to be.  It is Entirely Tribal with the left.  It is not about right vs wrong.  It is instead about them vs us.

You, a terrible racist, just like many Islamists, white supremacists, etc, just eat up what looks tasty.  You seek not the truth but support for your own prejudices.

What is it about you that you are willing to patronize other haters and antisemites. (There are so many of them to write things for their hateful, vile, jealous of Jews readers to buy into.) The entire Muslim world has been working on this.

Everyone knows that there were a lot of Jews already living there already and that many fled from Europe and that many right after came from about 9 Arab Countries that (true to their ultra-racist ways) expelled the Jews they didn't kill or even worse.

The 'accusations' that they "tried" to get her to go to their hotel rooms, are not even harassment in my book. Not unless she is accusing them of coercion, which I don't think she is.

Europeans ended up on top of the world due to their smarts and ingenuity and whatever else.  90% of the modern world and all its goodies and advancements have been created by Europeans.  And PS, the British led the fight against slavery for the first time in mankind.

When on the rarest of occasions something "approximating this" happens, like a white person defending themselves from brain trauma or death, as did George Zimmerman, then it is more than front-page news.

I personally think she should leave the court and join Biden as his Vice Presidential pick.  Why should just the top of the ticket be feeble and way past their "good to lead date"?

They embrace it, as long as it furthers there cause.  They have that in common with the ideology of Islamism.  Leftists have their own version of taqiya.

Even if she is making that statement it is extraordinarily wrongheaded to think that people in Ukraine would interpret it that way.  1941-1944  Over 1million Jews were killed by The Nazis and their Ukrainian Collaborators in the Holocaust/WW2.

Then employed black people, and everyone else, and made them famous and filthy rich. And look at who is so ungrateful and bigoted and evil and trying to put the worst possible spin on it. The Jews despised the KKK.

If you had any intelligence you would recognize that, because it's quite obvious.

I think you, in particular, and anyone else that is so easily fooled, can not discern truth from fiction.  You can not put things in perspective what so ever.  You just find dishonest, bigoted authors who are as evil and as bigoted as yourself to latch onto.

I did a tweet on it (which I've been trying to find) where I referenced an article (that I'm also trying to find) that seemed to conclude that the number was much lower than 300.  Either way, it was a pogrom. pic.twitter.com/lREPlapVih

According to what I've read the first estimates of deaths were wildly inflated and the consensus now is that about 36 died, with about a third of them having been white.
* [17 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200717073110/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1284022934751805441): Your profile pic is of a white woman.  Or so it seems.

You just try to prove something that you want to by ignoring all evidence to the contrary.  It is a common way of doing things for ideologues.  Especially when they have an evil ideology, like leftism.

Are you saying the second half is an example of creating your own facts, or are you saying that Hitler murdered Jews because they were trying to take over Germany?  All 1% of them?
* [17 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200717064540/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1284007551156322305): That is what precipitated the confrontation, where all those white men were shot and many killed. It was that killing that led directly to the riot.  As far as that tactic, it is widely known that the disparity between black men raping white women and the opposite is astronomical
* [17 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200717063809/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1284013153500766213): Something very new is happening.  Human activity is for the first time being widely recorded.  Not by the BS news outlets, but by billions of cellphone cameras and security cameras.  It is being disseminated over the internet, especially on social media. And this'll last forever. https://twitter.com/NuBlackVision/status/1284004649972969472

And documented on videotape from all over the world.  I don't think videotape is your friend.  Talk about an understatement. I think that for the first time in world history life and behavior is being documented digitally😱
* [17 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200717072415/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1284010150429364224): That's a perfect GIF from you.  A very dramatic way of saying nothing.  Barack Obama was great at that, but I digress.  I never said blacks were the root of American racism, but I will say that America is an extremely racist country and that is antiwhite racism from blacks.
* [17 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200717065114/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283982780175712257): For God's sake.  This is like the second worse thing you have and it doesn't even equal the anti-white murder and mayhem of one night in America.  And this daily carnage against whites has been going on for over 50 years.
* [17 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200717065114/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283982780175712257): Guess what Black Watch, not nearly as many blacks were lynched year by year or in total, as the number of whites that are viciously murdered by blacks, often gratuitously, and often horribly, year by year or in total.  Not even close.
* [17 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200717065114/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283982780175712257): That riot wasn't a fraction as bad as the rioting from blacks that happen again and again and nationwide.  Also, the Tulsa rioting started after like 7 whites were shot dead in one shooting.  (which may have actually been justified), but it wasn't entirely without reason like now
* [17 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200717064734/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1284006516954144769): The mistake you are making is very basic.  You are looking narrowly at one phenomenon and looking at only the negative. You're not comparing whites to blacks or anyone else, and you're not looking for truth or perspective.  You're looking at whites like a prosecutor, not a judge.
* [17 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200717061447/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283993578541285377): It seems to me that horrible people respect other horrible people and turn their attention to good people like the Jews.

But a similar approach is needed at our schools, which are PUBLICALLY FUNDED!  The leftist media would just reconstitute if we don't stop our schools from churning out left-wing, brain dead zombies.
* [17 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200717061447/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283993578541285377): Our Western world speaks with a  'progressive' voice. And 'progressives' seem not to care in the slightest for human rights.  Whether it's in the Middle East, Africa, China, N. Korea...  If they discuss this at all it is usually to defend their practices and attack their critics.

You obviously don't see things as they are but see them through tribal and racist eyes.

"1,000 good rattlesnakes out of a thousand are good". "2 or 3 white people trying to do good don't see the other million trying to kill me"

"The first one that throws a stone gets arrested.  The first one that spits at a cop, or tries to start a fire or breaks a window.  Then you don't get a riot.  You don't get vandalism or destruction of statues etc."

I said you misunderstood his 'statement'.  Which you very much did.  I'm glad we are in agreement with your clearly being a racist though. And of course, blacks can be racist.  You and so many millions prove that every day.
* [17 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200717035042/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283948641330368515): This tweet is ridiculous. 1st, how can you misunderstand that statement so badly?  2nd, you are revealing your racism here for all to see.  You " can read his sick, depraved, WHITE mind".  If you were white and the subject of a much different standard, you prob couldn't say that.

The last figure I saw was that there were 270 black on black killings for every 1 'unarmed' killing of a black by the police. That would come out to $2,700 dollars for every $1,000 dollars.

Is it because they respect that kind of brutality?  I don't know...but why?

* [16 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716021803/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283563096066469889): Dont even dare start with videos my friend.  I will crush you for life if I respond.  This video here might not even be about race.  I'm more upset that the man attacked a woman than the race part, anyway.  This was an attack based on something else.  You can obviously see that.

No society in human history has done as much to redress its past sins as has the United States.  Do you know how many Africans and other blacks immigrate voluntarily to the US each year?  And by the way, somehow they thrive here.
* [16 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716005603/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283561119517495298): They do.  And unlike the crack epidemic with blacks, no one seems to care about the epic suffering among the whites.
* [16 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716004210/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283560754298458113): White people are not even 1/10 as racist as blacks are.  How many times have you heard racist things come out of blacks mouths?  How many times have you heard them come out of whites' mouths?  My own experience is about 2000 to 1.  But that is just an estimate.
* [16 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716004202/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283558104005828608): I think that is a fascinating and very thoughtful point.  I hadn't heard it before but I think that calculus may be part of their thinking.
* [16 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716005022/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283557539095994368): The racial crime statistics have been compromised, just like television reporting and everything else.  Look at hate crimes.  There are probably 100 hate crimes against whites every single day and yet they are not counted.  I give up.
* [16 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716051933/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283554677892829185): Not at all true, and even if it were it wouldn't amount to 1 single day of murders by blacks.
* [16 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716004921/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283556009693380609): I don't believe those numbers at all, but if I did they show a lower percentage of crime from whites than there percentage of the population and a 300% larger crime rate among blacks.   Have a good evening.
* [16 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716001647/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283555169016467457): I guess he could for the same reason a white could do that because he is black.  But my point is that racial differences were not needed to enslave a people.
* [16 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716051933/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283554677892829185): I'm at a disadvantage because you are so obviously playing this game with a super weak hand and I have no desire to squash you.  I'll leave you to your delusions and b.s. and unexamined statistics.

You are so wrong but I have no desire to hit you over the head with how awful things really are.  No one in this country is especially afraid of whites and for good reason.  Least of all blacks. And blacks are not as afraid of the police as they are of them.
* [16 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716014351/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283552896953589761): How do you know it was based on race alone.  None of the traditional reasons for slavery came into play?  Who are you kidding?
* [16 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716013128/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283552495026016263): I'm done.  You are thoroughly immune from the facts.  Blacks commit more crime and violence in one day than all the white nationalists and supremacist groups together commit in one year.
* [15 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716001059/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283551674242600961): Blacks sold black slaves to whites.  Blacks still engage in slavery today in Africa.  Blacks are heavily involved in the human trafficking of women and children for sexual slavery today.

So much so that hate crimes against blacks need to be faked now to continue the fake narrative. Or you have to go to criminals in the act of terrible violence to use as examples of racism against them
* [15 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716000604/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283549967257305088): Violence, threats of violence.  Rudeness, insults, vandalism, bullying.  Racial taunts and insults.  What I have seen on Twitter has been so bad and so numerous than even after all that I have seen I was still completely shocked. I'm still in a state of shock over what I've seen.
* [15 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716001423/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283548377637179392): MLK, and the injustices that he fought and thankfully vanquished, were over 1/2 century ago.  How about in 50 yrs from now whites start rioting and demanding justice for all the beatings, rapes, robberies, murders and so forth that black people committed 50 years earlier.

How badly do you have to want to believe something to be convinced by this 1 single staged and edited video.  Look at the cumulative evidence, and look at it dispassionately.  If you did that you would be on the right side of the truth.  Listen.  You have NO case.

BTW, the video most certainly does not show that.  You have to be seriously unthoughtful to think that it does. The cumulative video evidence out there does show quite the opposite though.
* [15 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716021849/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283530732271542274): Have you noticed that most people that hate Trump and know he is a terrible person can not really articulate Why?   Just watch CNN for 10 minutes:  Trump is racist, fascist, stupid, crazy, crooked, etc    NOT REALLY WHY, OR HOW.  JUST THAT HE IS. Again & Again & Again & Again🤔

A. $10 for every black killed by a black. B. $1,000 for every 'unarmed' black killed by the police.

And the reason is OBVIOUS.  Just put your self in the place of a white cop.
* [15 July 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200716001152/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1283518750067699717): BTW, none of those videos or tweets you sent me prove a thing.  Keep trying though.

Maybe 3 of them were from whites towards blacks.   Almost all of the rest were blacks being racist toward whites.  If I add what I see and hear and read about from my computer, TV, and radio, the ratio stays the same.

So did everyone else who was drafted.  And many volunteered.  What does that have to do with the rampant and vile antisemitism visited upon Jews by blacks?

Don't go to work for Jews and then complain about them. The 'Jewish entertainment community made countless blacks rich, famous, and powerful.  There is much more of you than there are Jews.  And Jews don't get preferential treatment like blacks do.

But you're wrong because that truth is politically incorrect. Muslims are from the third world, not white, and not very successful.  So, according to the elites, whatever bad they do is ok and any talk or complaining about it is racist.🤪

All it shows is someone STUPIDLY  and VIOLENTLY fighting against the police, and getting shot. I can't tell if he was trying to get the gun.  And if it was a bad shoot so what.

The church of woke schools are teaching a fascistic doctrine where everyone is forced to comply, or they are to be canceled, fined, attacked, and more.

And they shouldn't sacrifice themselves in an attempt to elevate them.   There are many reasons why fighting back wouldn't work for Jews.

There is such a thing as Criminal Supremacy, and it affects many sociopathic criminals  The idea pushed by the leftist psychological community that aggressive criminals usually have low self-esteem is more political than psychological.

We don't know that they are not black just because it is in Mexico.  There are 1 1/2 million blacks in Mexico. The original tweet that I copied the video from said that it was in NYC.

If it is what it looks like, and he was the only one who did this, then it would be a terrible but rare act of horrible public violence by a white person.

They believe the lies the same way other white liberals do.

I know how different places are from each other.  There is no good reason to live amongst people  that are violent and hateful towards you if you can move somewhere else.

I'm talking about people in general.  I'm talking about black people brutally attacking white people, and nonwhite people even more.

That will never make the news.  Even though it very dangerous for people to not know how common that is.  Many, many people have been hurt and killed because they believed the MSM lie.

I don't know if the news reports are censoring the incredible amount of bigotry and violence that comes from the black community.

(At least I did before COVID and the shutdown)  But even with a Republican sweep I don't know if Trump can turn this country around.  He is a miracle man, but so far he has had little impact of turning the left around. Some impact, but not enough.

This is what I fear would be determinative:  They are going to open the gates and let everyone in, especially those that would be destructive in one way or another.  After they do that, there will be no putting it back together.

I don't know how to weigh that against the indoctrinated people coming out of college.  College attendance has been steadily increasing, as has the boldness of their indoctrination efforts.  It is elites who drive the culture also.

They own the schools, and they are using them to transform us.  They are well on there way.  There is one thing they can do that will achieve their victory.  Open the gates, and let everyone in.  That is their plan, and they are so close.
* [23 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200523022148/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1264011918991413257): How about Trump + COVID 19 + whatever else because it is going to take an awful lot to prevent us from succumbing to leftism, and what will follow.  Look at Europe. They have gone left. What is coming now because they have gone left?  Open borders, and Islam.

And that is exactly what has been happening.  That is the reason, in my opinion, that we look at the news media and the politicians with our mouths agape and just can't believe what we are hearing.

In this election cycle, his biggest challenge was that all of the other candidates emulated him.   JFK would be a Republican now.  Barack Obama is now seen as too moderate.

And I can't imagine anything as volatile.  The students, Hollywood, and the MSM will go hog wild.  But I don't see how we can survive until we wrest away the lefts complete control over the shaping of our youth.

School boards are local but the Department of Education is national.  The colleges and universities that give out teaching degrees are increasingly leftist.  And the transformation for students in most fields happens in college.

And I think that can only happen if we get ahold of the schools, which is where this leftist nonsense is ultimately all coming from.
* [22 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200522233325/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1263973131095597056): If you look at the trend line, you can see that the country as a whole is moving left, and the left itself is moving right off of the cliff.  Will this ANTI-police, gun rights, religious freedom, Whites, Borders, capitalism, Israel, due process, etc. only get worse?

He is the 'worst ever', 'racist', 'incompetent', 'inept,' 'corrupt'?  And then they all repeat each other as if they are repeating arguments, when they are not.

But I think that just having those Jews in leadership positions has prevented the rest of the Dems from transitioning to being openly anti-Israel.  As they retire, I think the Dems may just openly declare it.

I don't know if it is just plain unconstitutional to initiate a lockdown under any conditions?  It may very well be.  But the justification of many actions after, including the length of the lockdown, has been more problematic and probably more clearly unconstitutional.

The enviers try to use this video to demonstrate how afraid the Jewish men are of the small animal.  They don't relate to being afraid of hurting it.  They don't feel that powerful drive to not harm a living being. To me this just seems like more envy. https://twitter.com/SpookyGhost32/status/1260991177962250242

My problem is in not acknowledging the present.  (Since 1970, at least) We are trying to pretend that we are somehow back pre 1950 and blacks are going around afraid of us.

In fact,  he was so  very innocent that the thought that they could be mistakenly thinking that he had committed some crime just didn't enter his mind.  It just simply did not occur to him.

I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of both parties. The only way to defend his actions would be to purposely ignore the side of the two men trying to hold him, and additionally choosing the most extreme and unlikely variables among the possible ones

I would make the same argument regardless.  The experience only further buttresses my argument.  And again, this is a distraction.  I want to know why this is considered a big story in the first place?
* [16 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200516060846/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1261528223269216257): I give up.  Just imagine they were two Israeli men and it was a Palestinian who they suspected of being a burglar.   It is not that dissimilar of a situation.  It is quite similar actually.   And in both cases, the deseased would have forced the outcome that came about.

He was some kind of cop for goodness sake.  Of course they relayed to this violent felon why they were confronting him.

Why in the name of God wouldn't they.  You must throw away everything you normally would expect to make that argument.

That guy knew he was acting suspiciously.  He has a record. (One that the dishonest media is not highlighting.)  And it wouldn't even matter if he was a Choir boy.

Why is a case of two people trying to make a citizen's arrest (even if they went about it in a way that can be considered criminal) defending themselves against a subsequent attack more newsworthy then the daily murders of whites that are on purpose❓
* [16 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200516071014/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1261524138319118336): Our problem is that we both know if this were the reverse the two men would probably be considered heros.  If not, than it certainly would not have turned out this way at all, especially with all of the publicity.

Only an exceedingly violent person who probably thinks the police will arrest him for what he has done.  Or he may be innocent of the crime but still an exceedingly violent person.

Even a Drunk crazy man would know that you don't attack a man holding a shot gun on you. This guy had no choice but to protect himself and his father after that maniac attacked him that way. His obvious intent was to wrestle the shot gun away from him.

I can't imagine a reasonable person trying to beat up a person holding a rifle on them in order to get them to stay still.    Why is a case of probable self defense headlined in such a way in the Times anyway?

On 30 November 1947, The 'Palestinians' began murdering their Jewish Neighbors. This is the Truth. Truth Matters.

My God, it is actually unbelievable.   And no...being innocent while being railroaded by utterly corrupt politicians does not mean that you let everyone testify.  If it were a search for the truth, yes.  But it was the opposite.

I'm talking about how the entire elite establishment is treating him. Not about how Obama is treating Trump.  But now that you bring it up...Of course, this speech was nothing compared to the coup attempt. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeGpLg0b3DE

He is treated to the most disrespect any president has ever been treated, at least since WWII and modern communications. If the worst president ever (Obama) were treated 1/8 as badly, the world would stop and you might one of those with the loudest objections

Think about it.  He insists on doing things the way he does, not kowtowing to the PC bigots,  them despite the unprecedented backlash that he has endured.   Who else could have withstood what he has?

The reason I have asked the question is that I have long felt that the original tweet author did not like it.  I'm talking about when my tweet is  in support of the original tweet.

That should not have escalated that way.  I think it is a clear case of Darwins Law. What he did to the guy holding the rifle was a far worse crime (If the guy with the Rifle even committed a crime).  It was worse in every way.

No one has a right to pound your face and violently pull a rifle out of your hands.  He wasn't trying to kidnap him or to shoot him.  He was holding him for the police.

The video doesn't come up immediately when you do a search.  It's like they are trying to bury or obscure it. What I did see was the deceased violently attacking a man holding a rifle.

* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513034457/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260321531806310408): "FALSELY & VICIOUSLY" He never even made that claim as far as I can tell.  He just questioned it.  As I do.  His "birth certificate" is not 100% bulletproof by any stretch.  If it were Trump's birth certificate the media and others would have TRULY VETTED that certificate.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513185434/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260320343140556804): What a wild, baseless, and unsubstantiated claim.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513031743/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260320056698982402): Your claim that Trump is antisemitic is utterly ludicrous and utterly indefensible.  Your attempt to defend that claim failed completely.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200514173916/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260319696689168386): I am surprised that you voted for McCain.  Maybe you saw more clearly what many of us were unable to see.  Unfortunately for the Republicans, President Trump, and the Nation.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513203625/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260319313686417408): I don't even know what "birtherism" is.  In fact, it seems very much like a made-up concept by the left, specifically to tarnish Trump.  Obama's father was Kenyan.  He was not a Kenyan American, but a Kenyan.  He only spent a couple of years here as a college student.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513133502/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260318128023666689): Neither you nor I know all of the facts in that case.  I see the media in real-time totally distort what Trump is doing, his intent in doing it, and his reasoning for doing it.  In. real. time.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200514095957/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260317349166678017): Utter nonsense.   I still don't know if Obama was born here.  Why should there be special rules that protect black people only?  Trump has questioned the citizenship of nonblacks, and the Dems have questioned the citizenship of many candidates and others.  Civil War???
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513000744/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260315921543036928): I don't know the details either but I would wager that Trump had his hand in turning that trend around.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513142527/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260315657587109888): Trump is a wonderful president and a wonderful leader of our country.  What he is as a man is not the same as what he is as the country's leader. And he has not been "especially" immoral, or purposely harmful to others. I mean, compared to who?
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200512230835/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260314693534695429): Why is it rude to assume what people (probably) think.  You wouldn't make it through the day if you did not do that.  We all do it, and we have to do it.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200512201543/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260300052184084480): You are so wrong.  Holocaust denial from Trump? Are you kidding me?
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200512232836/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260277617888038918): Biden is a con man, a grifter, a flim-flam man.  He has no strong core political beliefs. His main constituency is himself and what benefits him. He cannot be trusted on Israel or anything else for that matter.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200514011345/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260273565305364486): I think that the left has always been antisemitic.  What has happened is the liberal Democrats, liberal Labour Party, etc have become more and more leftist.  Leftism has been ascendant, and unless it is turned around, yesterday, it will be a disaster for western civilization.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200512211534/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260267912616710144): His skin color was an afterthought.  Trump is not the type to have animosity on something as trivial as skin color.  That's the province of the left.   I'll bet he likes India.  Trump isn't Jewish but he likes us.  Trump married two immigrants. PC is racist and Trump rejects it.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513002745/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260265070099120131): "Birtherism was based on racism which is hate." Uh, not even close.      "When I was a kid he purposely put in the papers is cheating on his first wife. That's a bad human."  He is a better and more caring president than any of them would ever be.👊

If I knew I would get there in one piece though, I think I would.  I bet much of the future will be fantastic and likely they will be able to extend our lifespan far, far beyond what it is now.

I'm pretty sure I've seen him tweet that he misses some that follow him despite his efforts and requests a DM to let him know he may have missed you.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200512124425/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260088252423450624): I don't think that they are inside.  I wish they were and that chunks of concrete rained down on their heads.  I'll just have to wait for Israel to drop some on them.    #TheVeryWorstPeopleInTheWorld

I remember when I did try it a check or something came on it. Funny thing is, I just looked at a couple of people including yourself, and I don't even see it available? pic.twitter.com/5D3j5b2gRH

I think liberals use it also.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200512181308/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260089955474440192): 😊

I think American Judaism has largely been taken over by leftism. The more educated people are, the more leftist they are.  That is because colleges and universities have become leftwing seminaries.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513103105/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260090877101432833): My emojis only work on occasion.  I have an extension on Chrome that works much better than the one that Twitter provides. I think Twitter does an amazing job.  I know that may be unpopular, but I'm kind of awed at how well Twitter works.  Just look at Palor and compare.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200512110530/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260080002340716549): Thank you for responding.  I was beginning to get worried and about to send you another tweet to tell you just that--That my previous tweet was meant largely in jest.😊

Do you mean his "Tweets and Replies" or just on his timeline?  I would also advise you to contact  @Dbargen  via DM, but first to go to his "likes" for his many tips.

At least I was thinking that before this virus hit.  It's a bit up in the air now, but I'm thinking his Jewish vote will surprise people.
* [12 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200512090046/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1260082052763975681): I'll bet most of them don't even know about it.  I don't mean that they never heard about it.  I just mean that they don't really KNOW about it.  It is not what they hear from their news sources or their family or friends.  They are in a great big self-reinforcing bubble.

What is their reasoning, or their benefit? Do they actually think the ethical thing to do is to continue to funnel money to a corruptocracy that underwrites antisemitism, murder, and mayhem?

Why should the federal government bail them out so they can be re-elected and continue their inept governance?

Twitter only shows me abut 200 of them at most.  I find that when I  engage with people, their posts come down my timeline.  I'll bet you have been seeing my posts in the last couple of days where you weren't seeing them much last week.

When they get reinstated, they usually show up again as followers.  I can easily lose 50 or more followers every day that way.  And then many will bounce back.

Especially if they don't follow you.  If you get 4500 or so that follow you, you can start going above the 5000

* [11 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513162649/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1259728537176674305): It sounds funny to me like that, but not anywhere near as funny as the unfortunate possible alternative.
* [11 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200511171040/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1259728130375286785): Hearing it correctly would not create any problem.  But reading it...one would naturally use the less startling pronunciation.  It would be difficult to say it out loud the wrong way like "pucks".  I would look at it and say it any other way and hope that I was right.

* [11 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200512033827/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1259721976194703360): 🙃😎😊

* [11 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200513002155/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1259716727425904643): I just wish I could hear his name said out loud.  Perhaps it rhymes with "hooks"?  Is there another alternative besides that or rhyming with "Pucks" like hockey pucks?
* [11 May 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200514113849/https://twitter.com/GlennnRoss/status/1259717146302693376): Last name.  The first was no prize either.🙃

I believe the subject is also well covered well in Alan Dershowitz's book "The Case for Israel".  He also goes over every other aspect of the rightness or wrongness of Israel's existence.

There seems to be a great tolerance or illogic and nonsense from the world when it comes to bad actors.  It seems that only the good or those striving to be good are held to account.  They seem to resent the effort.
